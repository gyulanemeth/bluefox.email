# What SaaS Owners Need to Know About DMARC

Running a SaaS business means protecting your brand and your customers. One of the key tools to help you do that is DMARC—a protocol designed to stop email spoofing, where attackers send emails that look like they’re from your domain. Here’s a straightforward look at why DMARC matters and how to get it set up.

### What is DMARC?

DMARC, which stands for **Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance**, is a way to protect your email domain from being used in phishing attacks. It helps ensure that only legitimate emails from your domain reach your customers. If someone tries to spoof your domain, DMARC can block those emails or send them to spam.

### Why You Should Care About DMARC

1. **Protects Your Brand**
   If someone sends phishing emails pretending to be from your company, it can seriously damage your reputation. DMARC helps you stop this before it happens.

2. **Improves Email Delivery**
   Email providers are more likely to deliver your emails to the inbox if they’re confident those emails are legit. DMARC helps with that, making sure your real emails don’t get stuck in spam.

3. **Keeps You Informed**
   DMARC gives you reports on who’s sending emails from your domain. You’ll know if something’s off and can fix it before it becomes a problem.

### How to Set Up DMARC for Your SaaS

1. **Start with SPF and DKIM**
   Before DMARC can work, you need to set up SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail). These tools tell email providers which servers are allowed to send email for your domain and verify that the emails haven’t been tampered with.

2. **Create a DMARC Policy**
   You create a DMARC policy by adding a DNS record to your domain. This tells email providers what to do if an email fails the DMARC check—whether to do nothing (just monitor), send it to spam, or reject it outright. Start with a “none” policy to see how things are going before making it stricter.

3. **Monitor Your Reports**
   Once you set up DMARC, you’ll start getting reports that show how your emails are doing. These can be technical, but they’re useful for spotting any problems early on.

4. **Make Adjustments**
   As you get comfortable with the data, you can tweak your DMARC settings to be more protective. It’s a good idea to review and adjust regularly as needed.

### Bottom Line

DMARC isn’t just another piece of tech jargon—it’s a practical tool that helps keep your SaaS business safe from email fraud. Setting it up might take a little time, but it’s worth it to protect your brand and ensure your emails get where they need to go. If you haven’t set up DMARC yet, now’s a good time to start.
