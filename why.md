# Why SaaS companies should use bluefox.email?

Wait a second... What is bluefox.email?

It's a platform that makes it effortless for SaaS companies to **send and track beautiful marketing, and transactional emails**.

A good impression is invaluable. We believe, that email communication should be consistent with your brand, and it should be an integral part of your product.

If your email does not look, or even worse, it does not reach your customers' inbox, that demolishes the good impression that you built up with a lot of hard work.

::: danger Typical SaaS email problems (and you might have all of these.):

1) **Inconsistent look and feel.**
  - you store your transactional emails in your codebase, so it's quite painful to update them
  - you use mailchimp or something similar for marketing emails, something else for transactional
  - after a while it's getting extremely hard to manage your emails
2) **Lot of rendering issues.**
  - the mobile experience is poor
  - design falls apart in different email clients, especially in ***Outlook***
  - it is too tedious to create proper HTML emails, so you end up using less converting text emails
3) **Emails don't reach the inbox.**
  - your emails end up in spam and you don't understand why.
  - you use a provider with lot of blacklisted IP addresses
  - you don't have the proper metrics (bounce etc.)

## Beautiful emails in a single place

Let's make sure that your transactional and marketing emails always look alike, and they are beautiful. Design systems in bluefox.email make this sure. You can create pixel-perfect design, that is applied to your whole email communication.

## No more email-rendereing issues

The email HTML we provide to you is battle-hardened. [Our founder's 10-year experience on the field](./about) makes it sure that your emails will render properly on mobile, web, and desktop, event on Outlook.

## Reach the inbox, avoid spam

AWS SES has a famously good deliverability, and its price is unbeatable. They have very strict processes, for example, if your bounce rate goes up, you will have to fix that in a certain amount of time.

That's why we decided that our customers have to hook up their own AWS SES with our system. Don't worry, if you don't have experience with AWS. We can help you!

::: warning
If you are thinking about sending spammy email, this platform is not for you. If you happen to spam people, AWS will simply revoke your access to SES.

## Simple and fair pricing

Most of the providers charge you for the number of contacts you have in combination with the number of emails you send. This cryptic pricing **always** end up to be more than you think.

### Paid version ($0.2 per 1000 emails)

We only charge for the **number of emails you send.** Simple.

It is very cheap: $0.2 per 1000 emails sent. (Plus another $0.1 to AWS for SES.)

You can buy the following credit packs:
 - $10 -> send 50.000 emails
 - $100 -> send 500.000 emails
 - $1000 -> send 5.000.000 emails

You can use your credits for a year! It means that you don't need to pay a monthly subscription fee if you don't use the service.

### Forever free version

You can also use bluefox.email for free, if we can put our logo and link to your emails.

Keep in mind, that AWS offers a free tier for 12 months, including 3000 email sends per month.

The two combined should be enough to kick off your project!
