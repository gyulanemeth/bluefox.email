# Why SaaS companies should use bluefox.email?

Wait a second... What is bluefox.email?

It's a platform that makes it effortless for SaaS companies to **send and track beautiful transactional, triggered and marketing emails**.

A good impression is invaluable. We believe that email communication should be consistent with your brand and an integral part of your product.

If your email does not look good, or even worse, it does not reach your customers' inbox, it can ruin the good impression you worked hard to build.

::: danger Typical SaaS email problems (and you might have all of these.):

1) **Inconsistent design.** Transactional and marketing emails look totally different.
2) **A lot of rendering issues.** Emails fall apart on different clients, especially on **Outlook**.
3) **Emails don't reach the inbox.** And oftentimes, you don't understand why.

## Reach the Inbox, Avoid Spam

AWS SES has famously good deliverability, and its price is unbeatable. They have very strict processes to filter out spammers. For example, if your bounce rate slightly goes up, you have to fix it within a certain amount of time.

That's why we decided that our customers must connect their own AWS SES to our system.

Don't worry if you don't have experience with AWS. We can help you!

::: warning
If you are thinking about sending spammy emails, this platform is not for you. If you happen to spam people, AWS will simply revoke your access to SES.

## Simple and Fair Pricing

Most providers charge you based on the number of contacts you have combined with the number of emails you send. This cryptic pricing **always** ends up costing more than you think. Our [pricing](/pricing) is credit-based, so you only pay for the number of emails you sent, and you can use your credits for a whole year!

### Free Version

When you create a workspace, you get 36000 credits for free. You can use it for branded sends, which means that we put our logo and a link to our website in your emails.

Keep in mind that AWS offers a free tier for 12 months, including 3000 email sends per month.

The two combined should be enough to kick off your project!
