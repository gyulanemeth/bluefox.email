# Why Marketing Agencies use BlueFox Email

Wait a second... What is BlueFox Email?

It’s an email platform built for **marketing agencies** that send for **multiple clients**. Manage separate client projects, invite clients to collaborate, and reuse your best emails and automations across every account with client-specific overrides.

### A good impression is invaluable.

We believe that email communication should be consistent with clients' brand and should look great on all email devices.

If an email does not look good, or worse, doesn’t reach the inbox, it can ruin the impression you worked hard to build.

::: danger If you run email for multiple clients, you’ve seen these problems:

1) **Managing multiple clients is chaos.** Constant juggling with logins, late requests and approvals.
2) **You rebuild the same templates, automations & segments from scratch.** New client = same work every single time.
3) **Design & rendering issues waste hours.** Looks good in the editor, breaks in Outlook for no reason.
4) **Reporting drains hours.** You spend more time creating reports than sending campaigns every month.
5) **Great emails land in spam.** And clients blame you, even though you don’t know what went wrong this time.
6) **Pricing squeezes margins.** Contact-based billing gets expensive fast, especially when growth triggers hidden cost jumps.

:::

The good news? BlueFox Email was built to eliminate every one of these problems.

## Manage Multiple Clients Without Chaos  
BlueFox Email gives you **clean, separated client projects** with proper team roles and permissions. No shared logins, no scattered assets, just a structured way to run email at agency scale.

## Build Once. Reuse Everywhere.  
Save templates, automations, segments, and contact properties as reusable assets. When a new client comes in, **deploy entire email systems in minutes**, not days. Stop starting from zero every single time.

## Emails That Don’t Break (Even on Outlook)  
Our HTML is battle-tested and built for **real-world inboxes**: Gmail, Apple Mail, mobile, and yes, even **Outlook**. It comes from [our founder’s 10+ years of email design experience](./about), so layouts hold up where other builders fall apart.

## Client-Ready Reporting in Minutes  
BlueFox Email tracks opens, clicks, bounces, complaints and engagement automatically, then presents it in **simple, visual dashboards**. Export reports or share performance without digging through spreadsheets.

## Deliverability You Can Trust  
Stop guessing. BlueFox Email helps you **authenticate domains, monitor bounce & complaint rates**, and understand inbox placement risks at a glance. Get alerts when anything threatens inbox placement. Better sending habits become automatic, not a mystery.

::: warning
You must keep bounce rates below 2.5% and complaint rates below 0.05%.

## Pricing That Protects Your Margins  
Contact-based subscriptions are always overpriced. You pay more just because your clients grow. BlueFox Email flips the model: **only pay for sends**. No per-contact fees, no seat charges, no surprise jumps. Keep revenue in your agency, not in your ESP’s pocket. Check our [simple send-based pricing](./pricing).
