# What is DKIM?

DKIM stands for DomainKeys Identified Mail. It is a system that helps protect email senders and recipients from spam, forgery, and phishing. With DKIM, organizations can add a digital signature to their outgoing emails. This signature acts like a seal of authenticity, showing that the message really comes from the sender and hasn't been changed along the way.

## Quick Facts

| DKIM stands for       | DomainKeys Identified Mail                          |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| What it does         | Signs outgoing emails to prove they are genuine      |
| DNS record type      | TXT at `selector._domainkey.yourdomain.com`         |
| Helps prevent        | Email tampering and impersonation                   |
| Works with           | DMARC, SPF, DNS, SMTP                               |

## Why is DKIM Important?

Email is one of the most common ways for people and businesses to communicate, but it's also a target for scammers. Attackers can try to send fake emails that look like they come from someone you trust. DKIM helps stop this by letting email providers check if a message was really sent by the domain it claims to be from, and if it was changed after being sent.

When DKIM is set up, it helps:

- Build trust in your emails, so they are less likely to go to spam
- Protect your brand from being used in phishing attacks
- Make it harder for attackers to forge your emails

## How Does DKIM Work?

Here's a simple explanation of what happens when DKIM is used:

1. When you send an email, your mail server adds a special DKIM signature to the message header. This signature is created using a private key that only your server knows.
2. The recipient's mail server receives the email and looks up your public DKIM key in your domain's DNS records.
3. Using this public key, the recipient's server checks the signature. If it matches, the server knows the email is authentic and hasn't been tampered with.

If the signature doesn't match, the email might be marked as suspicious or rejected.

## What Does a DKIM Record Look Like?

To use DKIM, you need to add a special TXT record to your domain's DNS settings. Here is an example:

```txt
selector._domainkey.example.com. IN TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0G..."
```

- `selector` is a name you choose to identify the key (you can have more than one)
- `v=DKIM1` means this is a DKIM record
- `k=rsa` shows the type of encryption used
- `p=...` is your public key (a long string of letters and numbers)

## Setting Up DKIM

Setting up DKIM usually involves these steps:

1. Generate a pair of keys (one private, one public).
2. Add the public key to your DNS as a TXT record.
3. Configure your email server to sign outgoing emails with the private key.

Many email services, like Gmail, Microsoft 365, AWS SES, and BlueFox Email, can help you set up DKIM automatically or provide easy instructions.

## DKIM in Everyday Email

When you receive an email, your provider checks for a DKIM signature. If it's there and valid, the email is more likely to be trusted and delivered to your inbox. If it's missing or invalid, the email might be flagged as spam or rejected, especially if other protections like SPF and DMARC are also in place.

## Common Questions About DKIM

**Do I need DKIM if I already use SPF?**  
Yes. SPF checks who is allowed to send emails for your domain, but DKIM checks if the message was changed in transit and really came from your domain. Using both is much stronger.

**What if I use a third-party sender (like a newsletter service)?**  
You need to make sure they are set up to use DKIM for your domain. Most reputable services support this.

**How often should I update my DKIM keys?**  
It's a good idea to rotate your keys every year or so, or if you think your private key might have been exposed.

## DKIM Tags and What They Mean

| Tag | What it means           | Example                |
|-----|-------------------------|------------------------|
| v   | DKIM version            | v=DKIM1                |
| k   | Key type                | k=rsa                  |
| p   | Public key              | p=MIGfMA0G...          |
| s   | Selector (in DNS name)  | selector               |

## Summary

DKIM is a simple but powerful way to help protect your email reputation and your users from scams. By adding a digital signature to your emails, you make it much harder for attackers to pretend to be you. When combined with SPF and DMARC, DKIM is an important part of modern email security.
