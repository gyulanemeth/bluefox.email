# Bounce Management

**Bounce management** is the systematic process of handling, tracking, and responding to emails that are rejected by recipient mail servers. It's a critical component of email deliverability strategy that helps maintain sender reputation and optimize email campaign performance.

## What is Email Bounce Management?

Email bounce management is the **structured approach** to handling emails that couldn't be delivered to their intended recipients. When an email "bounces," it means the recipient's mail server has rejected the message and returned a notification to the sender. Effective bounce management involves identifying different types of bounces, understanding their causes, and taking appropriate actions to address underlying issues.

According to email deliverability standards, maintaining a bounce rate **below 2%** is considered good practice, with industry leaders often achieving rates under 1%. High bounce rates can trigger [spam](/email-sending-concepts/email-spoofing) filters and damage sender reputation, potentially causing future emails to be blocked even to valid recipients.

## Types of Email Bounces

Email bounces are categorized into two primary types, each requiring different management strategies:

### Hard Bounces

Hard bounces are **permanent delivery failures** that occur when an email can't be delivered for reasons that won't change over time. Major causes include:

- **Invalid email addresses** that don't exist on the recipient domain
- **Closed or deleted accounts** that were once valid but are no longer active
- **Blocked sender domains** where the recipient server has explicitly blocked your domain
- **Nonexistent domains** where the domain portion of the email address doesn't exist

Hard bounces require **immediate removal** of the address from your mailing list to protect your sender reputation. Most email service providers automatically suppress hard bounces to prevent repeated sending attempts.

### Soft Bounces

Soft bounces are **temporary delivery failures** that occur when an email can't be delivered due to potentially resolvable issues. Common causes include:

- **Full mailboxes** where the recipient has reached their storage limit
- **Server downtime or technical issues** at the recipient's mail server
- **Message size exceeds limits** set by the recipient's mail system
- **Greylisting** where the server temporarily rejects unknown senders

Soft bounces typically don't require immediate list removal but should be monitored. Most email systems automatically retry delivery for soft bounces over a 24-72 hour period before giving up.

## Best Practices for Bounce Management

Effective bounce management involves several key practices:

1. **Implement automated bounce processing** with [Amazon SNS](/aws-concepts/aws-sns) or other notification systems to react to bounces in real-time

2. **Maintain a suppression list** of hard bounced addresses to prevent accidental reuse in future campaigns

3. **Establish bounce thresholds** that trigger reviews or pauses in email campaigns when exceeded

4. **Regularly clean your email lists** by removing chronically bouncing addresses and inactive subscribers

5. **Monitor bounce trends** to identify patterns that might indicate larger deliverability issues

6. **Use email verification services** before sending to new lists to catch invalid addresses proactively

7. **Implement proper [SPF](/email-sending-concepts/spf), [DKIM](/email-sending-concepts/dkim), and [DMARC](/email-sending-concepts/dmarc)** records to improve authentication and reduce certain types of bounces

## Bounce Codes and Their Meaning

Bounce messages typically include [SMTP](/email-sending-concepts/smtp) response codes that provide specific information about the delivery failure:

- **5XX codes** (e.g., 550, 551) indicate permanent failures (hard bounces)
- **4XX codes** (e.g., 421, 450) indicate temporary issues (soft bounces)
- **Specific subcodes** provide more detailed information about the exact cause

Understanding these codes helps in properly categorizing bounces and taking appropriate action. For instance, a 550 "Mailbox not found" requires immediate address removal, while a 421 "Service not available" might warrant retry attempts.

## How Email Service Providers Handle Bounces

Modern email service providers like Amazon SES handle bounces through a multi-step process:

1. **Detection**: The ESP receives and parses bounce notifications from recipient servers
2. **Classification**: Bounces are categorized as hard or soft based on response codes
3. **Notification**: Bounce information is forwarded to the sender via webhooks, API, or SNS Topics
4. **Suppression**: Hard bounced addresses are automatically added to suppression lists
5. **Reporting**: Bounce metrics are compiled into reports for sender analysis

This automation simplifies bounce management but still requires senders to monitor trends and take strategic action when needed.

## Bounce Management and Sender Reputation

Email bounces directly impact sender reputation, which determines whether your future emails reach the inbox or spam folder. Major ISPs and email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook use bounce rates as a key metric when evaluating sender quality.

Consistently high bounce rates signal to receiving servers that the sender doesn't follow list hygiene best practices. According to deliverability experts, maintaining bounce rates **below 2%** is essential for preserving good sender reputation. Services like Amazon SES enforce even stricter guidelines, requiring bounces to stay **below 5%** to maintain unrestricted sending privileges.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Bounce Management

### How quickly should I remove hard bounced addresses?
Hard bounced addresses should be removed from your active mailing lists **immediately** after the bounce is detected. Most email sending platforms do this automatically, but you should verify this process is working correctly.

### How many retry attempts should I make for soft bounces?
Industry standard practice is to retry soft bounces **3-5 times over 24-72 hours** before considering the address problematic. After multiple failures, these addresses should be flagged for review or removal.

### Can a previously hard-bounced address become valid again?
While technically possible (if someone recreates a deleted account with the same address), it's extremely rare and not worth the risk to sender reputation. Best practice is to maintain permanent suppression of hard bounced addresses.
