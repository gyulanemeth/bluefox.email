# IP Reputation

**IP Reputation** refers to the historical sending behavior and trustworthiness associated with a specific IP address used to send email. This reputation score significantly influences whether emails are delivered to recipients' inboxes, filtered to spam folders, or blocked entirely, making it a **fundamental component** of [email deliverability](/email-sending-concepts/deliverability).

## What is IP Reputation?

IP reputation is a dynamic score or rating assigned to email sending IP addresses based on their historical sending behaviors and recipient interactions. It serves as a primary metric that mailbox providers and ISPs use to make initial filtering decisions about incoming mail. The better your IP reputation, the more likely your messages will reach your subscribers' inboxes.

## How IP Reputation Works

Email receivers calculate IP reputation by continuously monitoring key metrics including [spam complaints](/email-sending-concepts/complaints), sending volume consistency, [bounce rates](/email-sending-concepts/bounce-rate), spam trap hits, blocklist presence, and proper [authentication](/email-sending-concepts/email-authentication) implementation. Each mailbox provider maintains its own proprietary scoring system, meaning your IP's reputation can vary across different receiving systems, with major providers like Gmail and Microsoft applying their own unique filtering algorithms.

## Why is IP Reputation Important?

IP reputation serves as a **critical first-line filter** in email delivery, functioning as the initial gatekeeper that determines whether your messages reach the inbox, get filtered to spam, or are blocked entirely. It directly impacts deliverability success, affects sending capacity through ISP throttling limits, helps bypass content filters, and remains essential even as [domain reputation](/email-sending-concepts/domain-reputation) grows in importance.

## Types of IP Addresses

The management approach for IP reputation varies depending on which type of IP address you use for sending:

| IP Type | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Dedicated IP** | Used exclusively by one sender with complete reputation control | High-volume senders (>100K emails/month) |
| **Shared IP** | Used by multiple senders with collectively influenced reputation | Low-volume senders with less consistent sending |
| **IP Pool** | Multiple IPs used in rotation to distribute sending load and risk | Enterprise environments and ESP configurations |

## Building and Maintaining IP Reputation

Building a positive IP reputation requires **strategic execution** focused on proper **IP warming** (gradually increasing volume over 4-8 weeks), maintaining **consistent sending patterns** without sudden spikes, sending only to **permission-based engaged recipients**, implementing proper **authentication** ([SPF](/email-sending-concepts/spf), [DKIM](/email-sending-concepts/dkim), [DMARC](/email-sending-concepts/dmarc)), monitoring key metrics for early issue detection, processing [feedback loops](/email-sending-concepts/complaints) promptly, and providing easy [unsubscribe options](/email-sending-concepts/one-click-unsubscribe) to minimize complaint rates.

## IP Reputation Monitoring Tools

Several resources can help you assess the reputation of your sending IP addresses:

- **Postmaster Tools**: Google Postmaster Tools and Microsoft SNDS provide limited reputation insights.
- **Blocklist Monitoring**: Services like MXToolbox help check if your IP appears on major blocklists.
- **ESP Analytics**: Email service providers like [AWS SES](/aws-concepts/ses) often provide reputation metrics.
- **Third-Party Tools**: SenderScore, ReturnPath, and others offer comprehensive IP reputation monitoring.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to build an IP reputation?
Establishing a baseline IP reputation typically takes 4-8 weeks of consistent sending with positive engagement metrics, though building strong reputation with major providers may require several months.

### Can a bad IP reputation be fixed?
Yes, damaged IP reputation can be repaired through improved practices. For severe reputation damage, it's sometimes more efficient to migrate to a new IP address with proper warming procedures.

### Is a dedicated IP always better than a shared IP?
Not necessarily. Dedicated IPs suit high-volume senders with consistent practices, while low-volume senders (<100,000 emails/month) often benefit from shared IPs' collective sending patterns.

### How does IP reputation relate to domain reputation?
IP reputation and [domain reputation](/email-sending-concepts/domain-reputation) work together in filtering. IP reputation evaluates during SMTP connection, while domain reputation provides persistent identity across different sending infrastructures.
