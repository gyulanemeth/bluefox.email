# IP Reputation

**IP Reputation** refers to the historical sending behavior and trustworthiness associated with a specific IP address used to send email. This reputation score significantly influences whether emails are delivered to recipients' inboxes, filtered to spam folders, or blocked entirely, making it a **fundamental component** of [email deliverability](/email-sending-concepts/deliverability).

## What is IP Reputation?

IP reputation is a dynamic score or rating assigned to email sending IP addresses based on their historical sending behaviors and recipient interactions. It serves as a primary metric that mailbox providers and ISPs use to make initial filtering decisions about incoming mail. The better your IP reputation, the more likely your messages will reach your subscribers' inboxes.

## How IP Reputation Works

Email receivers maintain databases that track various metrics associated with each sending IP address. These metrics are continuously updated and contribute to an overall reputation score that influences how strictly the receivers filter emails from that IP.

| Factor | Impact on IP Reputation |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Spam Complaints** | High [complaint rates](/email-sending-concepts/complaints) severely damage IP reputation |
| **Sending Volume** | Sudden volume spikes can trigger reputation penalties |
| **Bounces** | Excessive [hard bounces](/email-sending-concepts/hard-bounce) indicate poor list quality and harm reputation |
| **Spam Traps** | Hitting spam traps causes significant reputation damage |
| **Blocklist Status** | Presence on email blocklists severely impacts reputation |
| **Authentication** | Proper [SPF](/email-sending-concepts/spf) and [DKIM](/email-sending-concepts/dkim) alignment improves reputation |

Different mailbox providers and filtering services maintain their own proprietary IP reputation systems, meaning your reputation may vary across different receiving systems.

## Why is IP Reputation Important?

IP reputation remains a **critical first-line filter** in the email delivery process, even as [domain reputation](/email-sending-concepts/domain-reputation) has gained prominence. When your email first connects to a receiving mail server, your IP address is immediately visible and evaluatedâ€”often before the content of your message is even examined.

IP reputation directly impacts email deliverability by influencing inbox placement rates, as messages from high-reputation IPs are more likely to reach the inbox while those from questionable IPs may be filtered or blocked. It also affects sending capacity, as major mailbox providers often impose sending limits (throttling) based on IP reputation. Additionally, a good IP reputation increases the likelihood that your emails will bypass certain content filters and reduces the risk of your mail being delayed due to additional scanning.

## Types of IP Addresses

The management approach for IP reputation varies depending on which type of IP address you use for sending:

- **Dedicated IP**: An IP address used exclusively by one sender, giving complete control over reputation but requiring consistent sending volume to maintain. Ideal for high-volume senders (>100,000 emails/month).
- **Shared IP**: An IP address used by multiple senders, where reputation is collectively influenced by all users. Suitable for lower-volume senders but carries the risk of being affected by others' sending practices.
- **IP Pool**: A collection of IP addresses used in rotation, distributing sending load and reputation risk. Common in enterprise environments and ESP configurations.

## Building and Maintaining IP Reputation

Establishing and preserving a positive IP reputation requires strategic planning and consistent execution:

- **IP Warming**: When using a new IP address, gradually increase sending volume over 4-8 weeks rather than immediately sending at full volume. This process, called **IP warming**, helps establish a positive reputation.
- **Consistent Volume**: Maintain relatively stable sending patterns without sudden, unpredictable spikes in volume.
- **List Quality**: Only send to engaged, permission-based lists with regular [list hygiene](/email-sending-concepts/bounce-rate) to minimize [bounces](/email-sending-concepts/bounces).
- **Authentication**: Properly implement [SPF](/email-sending-concepts/spf), [DKIM](/email-sending-concepts/dkim), and [DMARC](/email-sending-concepts/dmarc) to validate your sending identity.
- **Monitoring**: Track bounce rates, complaint rates, and blocklist status to detect potential issues early.
- **Feedback Loops**: Process [complaint](/email-sending-concepts/complaints) feedback loops promptly and remove complainers from your lists.
- **Easy Unsubscription**: Implement [one-click unsubscribe](/email-sending-concepts/one-click-unsubscribe) options to reduce complaint rates.

## IP Reputation Monitoring Tools

Several resources can help you assess the reputation of your sending IP addresses:

- **Postmaster Tools**: Google Postmaster Tools and Microsoft Smart Network Data Services (SNDS) provide limited reputation insights.
- **Blocklist Monitoring**: Services like MXToolbox allow you to check if your IP appears on major blocklists.
- **ESP Analytics**: Email service providers like [AWS SES](/aws-concepts/aws-ses) often provide reputation metrics.
- **Third-Party Reputation Tools**: Services such as SenderScore, ReturnPath, and others offer IP reputation monitoring.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to build an IP reputation?
Establishing a baseline IP reputation typically takes 4-8 weeks of consistent sending with positive engagement metrics. However, building a strong reputation with major providers may take several months of consistent, positive sending behavior.

### Can a bad IP reputation be fixed?
Yes, damaged IP reputation can be repaired through improved sending practices, list cleaning, and gradually rebuilding trust. However, in cases of severe reputation damage, it's sometimes more efficient to migrate to a new IP address and implement proper warming procedures.

### Is a dedicated IP always better than a shared IP?
Not necessarily. Dedicated IPs are ideal for high-volume senders with consistent volume and good practices. However, low-volume senders (<100,000 emails/month) often benefit from shared IPs due to more consistent sending patterns across the shared user base.

### How does IP reputation relate to domain reputation?
IP reputation and [domain reputation](/email-sending-concepts/domain-reputation) work together in modern email filtering. IP reputation is evaluated first during the SMTP connection, while domain reputation provides a more persistent identity that follows you across different sending infrastructures.
