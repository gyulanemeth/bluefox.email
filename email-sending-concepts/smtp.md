**Simple Mail Transfer Protocol** is the backbone of email delivery on the internet. Every time you hit "send," SMTP quietly takes over, moving your message from your outbox to the recipient’s inbox. While most users never see it in action, SMTP is one of the oldest and most essential protocols in the world of email.

## <a id="what-is-smtp"></a>What is SMTP?

**SMTP** is a protocol that enables the transfer of email messages between servers. When you send an email, SMTP is responsible for relaying your message from your email client or server to the recipient’s mail server. It’s a “push” protocol, meaning it only handles sending, not retrieving emails.

SMTP uses plain text commands and operates over the internet’s TCP/IP infrastructure. It’s designed to be simple, reliable, and universally compatible, which is why it’s still in use decades after its creation.

## <a id="how-does-smtp-work"></a>How Does SMTP Work?

When you send an email, your client (like Outlook or Gmail) connects to your outgoing mail server using **SMTP**. The process starts with a handshake (using commands like HELO or EHLO), then specifies the sender and recipient addresses, and finally transmits the message content.

The sending server then tries to deliver the message directly to the recipient’s mail server, again using SMTP. If the recipient’s server is temporarily unavailable, the sending server will keep retrying for a set period before giving up and returning an error.

SMTP typically uses port 25 for server-to-server communication, but port 587 is now standard for client-to-server submission, and port 465 is used for secure connections via SSL/TLS. By itself, SMTP does not encrypt messages, which is why modern email relies on extensions like **STARTTLS** for encryption and integrates with authentication protocols such as [**SPF**](/email-sending-concepts/spf), [**DKIM**](/email-sending-concepts/dkim), and [**DMARC**](/email-sending-concepts/dmarc).

## <a id="why-is-smtp-important"></a>Why is SMTP Important?

**SMTP** is the universal language of email transmission. Without it, email as we know it wouldn’t exist. Its simplicity and reliability have made it the standard for decades, allowing messages to flow seamlessly between different systems and providers.

SMTP’s extensibility has allowed it to evolve with the times. Security enhancements like **STARTTLS** and authentication checks with **SPF**, **DKIM**, and **DMARC** have kept SMTP relevant and secure, even as threats have grown more sophisticated.

For businesses, a properly configured SMTP setup means reliable delivery, fewer bounced emails, and better protection against spam and phishing. Whether you’re sending a single message or millions, SMTP is the protocol making it happen.

## <a id="frequently-asked-questions-about-smtp"></a>Frequently Asked Questions About SMTP

<div class="dkim-faq">

<div class="faq-item">
<h3 class="question">Is SMTP secure?</h3>
<div class="answer">
By default, SMTP does not encrypt messages. However, most modern servers use **STARTTLS** to encrypt the connection, and authentication protocols like SPF, DKIM, and **DMARC** to verify sender identity and prevent abuse. For sensitive data, consider using end-to-end encryption in addition to SMTP.

<div class="faq-item">
<h3 class="question">What’s the difference between SMTP, IMAP, and POP3?</h3>
<div class="answer">
**SMTP** is used for sending emails. IMAP and POP3 are used for retrieving emails from a server to your device. Most email clients use SMTP to send and IMAP or POP3 to receive.

<div class="faq-item">
<h3 class="question">Why do emails sometimes get stuck in the outbox?</h3>
<div class="answer">
Common reasons include incorrect SMTP server settings, authentication failures, network issues, or the recipient’s server being temporarily unavailable. Double-check your SMTP configuration and internet connection if you encounter this problem.
