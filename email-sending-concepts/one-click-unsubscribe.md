faqs:
  - question: "Is it legal to ask for a reason when someone unsubscribes?"
    answer: "You may request feedback after the unsubscribe is already processed, but making it required violates the one-click principle and regulatory requirements. When one-click unsubscribe is used, it's not possible to prompt for a reason before unsubscribing."
  - question: "Should we confirm unsubscribe requests with an email?"
    answer: "Confirmation emails are acceptable but must clearly indicate that the unsubscribe has already been completed with no further action required."
  - question: "How does One-Click Unsubscribe affect deliverability?"
    answer: "Implementing proper one-click unsubscribe typically improves deliverability metrics by reducing spam complaints and demonstrating compliance with best practices."
  - question: "Can we re-add users who have unsubscribed to our lists?"
    answer: "No, not without obtaining new explicit consent. Re-adding previously unsubscribed users without permission violates most email regulations and can severely damage sender reputation."

# One-Click Unsubscribe

**One-Click Unsubscribe** is a user-friendly mechanism that allows email recipients to **opt out of future communications with a single action**. This streamlined approach eliminates **friction** by removing the need for login credentials, complex forms, or additional confirmation steps, making it easier for users to manage their email preferences while helping senders maintain **clean lists** and comply with international regulations.

## What is One-Click Unsubscribe?

One-Click Unsubscribe provides email recipients with a standardized, **immediate method** to remove themselves from email lists or marketing communications. It appears as a special link or button near the sender information in modern [email clients](/email-sending-concepts/smtp.md) (like Gmail's "Unsubscribe" button). When clicked, it immediately processes the unsubscribe request **without requiring additional steps** from the user.

## How One-Click Unsubscribe Works

The One-Click Unsubscribe mechanism is primarily implemented through standardized [email headers](/email-sending-concepts/email-headers) that facilitate the process:

| Header Type | Purpose | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **List-Unsubscribe (HTTP)** | Provides a URL endpoint for unsubscribe requests | `<https://example.com/unsubscribe?token=abc123>` |
| **List-Unsubscribe (Mailto)** | Provides an email address for unsubscribe requests | `<mailto:unsubscribe@example.com?subject=unsubscribe>` |
| **List-Unsubscribe-Post** | Enables true one-click functionality with secure POST requests | `List-Unsubscribe=One-Click` |

Modern email clients like Gmail and Apple Mail scan these headers and display user-friendly unsubscribe options (e.g., buttons or links near the sender information). When users click these options, the client handles the technical process of sending the proper HTTP request or unsubscribe email automatically.

> **Note:** When users unsubscribe via the one-click unsubscribe method, they are only unsubscribed from the specific list from which they received the email. If the sender has implemented it, users can opt out of all communications by visiting the subscription preferences page linked in the email.

## Why is One-Click Unsubscribe Important?

One-Click Unsubscribe has become a critical component of modern email marketing because it enhances [deliverability](/email-sending-concepts/deliverability), reduces [spam complaints](/email-sending-concepts/complaints), improves user experience, manages list quality, and simplifies **regulatory compliance**. These benefits collectively result in better **[sender reputation](/email-sending-concepts/deliverability)**, higher engagement metrics, and a more efficient email marketing program.

## Regulatory Requirements

One-Click Unsubscribe functionality is mandated or recommended by multiple regulations globally:

- **CAN-SPAM Act (US):** Requires a visible and functional unsubscribe mechanism in all commercial emails, with processing required within 10 business days.
- **GDPR (EU):** Mandates that withdrawing consent must be as easy as giving it, practically requiring a simple unsubscribe method.
- **CASL (Canada):** Requires an easily performed unsubscribe mechanism, processed within 10 business days.
- **Australian Spam Act:** Requires a functional unsubscribe facility valid for at least 30 days after email receipt.

## Inbox Provider Requirements

Major inbox providers such as Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook require one-click unsubscribe for commercial senders exceeding 5,000 emails per day, based on provider policy rather than law. This is enforced through standards such as RFC 8058 and the use of appropriate `List-Unsubscribe` headers:

- [Yahoo sender requirements](https://blog.postmaster.yahooinc.com/post/739071159874887680/an-open-letter-to-email-senders-large-and-small)
- [Microsoft guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-insights/journeys/one-click-unsubscribe)
