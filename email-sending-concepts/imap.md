# IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)

While [SMTP](/email-sending-concepts/smtp) handles sending emails, IMAP is responsible for **retrieving emails** from your mail server and organizing them on your devices. It's the protocol that enables your emails to stay **synchronized across multiple devices**, allowing you to read, reply to, and organize messages on your phone, then see those same changes reflected on your computer.

## <a id="what-is-imap"></a>What is IMAP?

IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a **standard email protocol** that allows you to access your emails from any device while keeping them stored on the mail server. This means you can view, organize, and respond to messages from multiple devices, with all actions **synchronized automatically**.

Unlike its predecessor [POP3](/email-sending-concepts/pop3), which typically downloads and removes messages from the server, IMAP creates a **continuous connection** between your email client and the server. This connection enables real-time updates and ensures your email experience remains consistent across all your devices.

The current version, IMAP4, supports features like:

- **Folder management**: Create, rename, and delete folders on the server
- **Message flags**: Mark emails as read, important, or flagged for follow-up
- **Partial message retrieval**: Download just headers or specific parts of messages
- **Server-side searches**: Find messages without downloading your entire mailbox
- **Offline operations**: Make changes locally that sync when you reconnect

## <a id="how-does-imap-work"></a>How Does IMAP Work?

When you use an email client with IMAP, it establishes a **connection to your mail server** (typically on port 143 for unencrypted or port 993 for encrypted SSL/TLS connections). Unlike the "download and delete" model of POP3, IMAP keeps messages on the server while providing a **synchronized view** across devices.

Here's how the process works:

1. Your email client **connects to the IMAP server** using your credentials
2. The server responds with available mailboxes (folders) and message counts
3. The client typically downloads headers first (sender, subject, date) rather than entire messages
4. When you select a message, the client retrieves its contents from the server
5. Changes you make (reading, moving, deleting) are communicated back to the server
6. The server updates its records, making those changes visible to all connected devices

IMAP uses a **stateful connection**, meaning the client maintains an ongoing session with the server. This allows for efficient incremental updates and real-time notifications of new messages. Modern implementations also support **idle mode**, where the connection remains open for push notifications when new emails arrive.

For security, IMAP commonly uses **SSL/TLS encryption** to protect your messages and credentials in transit. Authentication typically employs **username/password combinations**, though more secure mechanisms like OAuth 2.0 are increasingly common.

## <a id="why-is-imap-important"></a>Why is IMAP Important?

In today's multi-device world, IMAP is **essential for consistent email access** across phones, tablets, computers, and web interfaces. Its server-centric model offers several critical advantages:

- **Device synchronization**: Actions taken on one device (reading, replying, organizing) are reflected everywhere
- **Reduced storage requirements**: Emails remain on the server, not consuming space on each device
- **Backup security**: Messages stay on the server where they can be properly backed up
- **Faster initial access**: Headers can be downloaded first, allowing quick browsing before full message retrieval
- **Bandwidth efficiency**: Only requested messages are transferred, not the entire mailbox.

For businesses, IMAP enables **collaborative features** like shared mailboxes and calendars. For individuals, it ensures you never lose access to important emails if a device is lost or damaged. The protocol's flexibility has made it the **standard choice** for most modern email services, including Gmail, Outlook.com, and Yahoo Mail.

## <a id="frequently-asked-questions-about-imap"></a>Frequently Asked Questions About IMAP

### Is IMAP better than POP3?
For most users, yes. IMAP keeps emails synchronized across all devices and stores them on the server for backup protection. POP3 typically downloads emails to a single device and often removes them from the server, which can lead to access issues and data loss. However, POP3 might be preferred in specific scenarios with limited connectivity or where local storage is a priority.

### Does IMAP use more bandwidth than POP3?
Initially, IMAP may use less bandwidth because it can download just headers rather than entire messages. However, over time, IMAP may use more bandwidth due to its continuous synchronization. The difference is rarely significant for most users, and the benefits of synchronization typically outweigh any bandwidth considerations.

### Can I use IMAP offline?
Yes, most IMAP clients cache messages locally, allowing you to read previously downloaded emails offline. Changes made offline (like moving or marking messages) are queued and synchronized when you reconnect. However, you cannot receive new messages or access undownloaded content while offline.

### Is IMAP secure?
IMAP itself doesn't provide security, but modern implementations use SSL/TLS encryption (IMAPS on port 993) to protect your connection. This prevents eavesdropping on your emails and credentials. Always ensure your email client is configured to use encrypted connections rather than plain IMAP.
