# Email Spoofing

Email spoofing is a tactic used by attackers to **forge the sender's address**, making it look like the email is from a trusted source. This method is often found in **phishing scams**, business email compromise (BEC), and various cyber frauds. It can deceive recipients into sharing sensitive information, clicking on harmful links, or transferring money.

## What is Email Spoofing?

Email spoofing occurs when the sender's email address is altered to **mimic someone else's identity**. This tactic takes advantage of the trust users place in familiar email addresses. The fundamental email protocol ([SMTP](/email-sending-concepts/smtp)) lacks robust security features, making spoofing relatively simple without proper safeguards.

Attackers leverage spoofing to:

- Pretend to be executives and request monetary transfers.
- Impersonate reputable brands to capture login information.
- Act as government agencies to distribute malware.
- Mimic colleagues to establish trust for subsequent attacks.

## How Does Email Spoofing Work?

Spoofing takes advantage of vulnerabilities in the email system, particularly the SMTP protocol. Here's a straightforward breakdown of the process:

1. **Header Forging**: The attacker alters the "From" field in the email header to mimic a trusted sender.

2. **Sending the Email**: The email is sent via an SMTP server that does not validate the sender's authenticity.

3. **Deceiving the Recipient**: The recipient receives the email and mistakenly believes it is from a legitimate source due to the spoofed name and address.

**Common Techniques**:

1. **Basic From Header Spoofing**: Simply changing the "From" address.

2. **Display Name Spoofing**: Using a recognizable name like "CEO" while hiding the actual attacker's email.

3. **Domain Lookalikes**: Employing similar-looking domains (for example, using company.com with a Cyrillic 'a').

4. **Combining Tricks**: Merging display spoofing with lookalike domains for added deception.

## Why is Email Spoofing Dangerous?

Spoofing presents serious cybersecurity and business challenges. It's frequently used in **Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams**, which have resulted in over [$43 billion in global losses from 2016 to 2023](https://www.ssh.com/academy/secure-information-sharing/what-is-business-email-compromise-bec), as reported by the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. 

Spoofed emails often act as gateways for **phishing attacks and malware**, leading to **data breaches** and compromised credentials. Moreover, beyond the technical risks, spoofing can harm your **reputation**, especially if customers receive fraudulent emails that seem to come from your domain, which can diminish trust and brand loyalty. 

Additionally, not implementing proper email authentication can expose organizations, particularly in regulated sectors like healthcare, finance, and government, to legal and compliance repercussions.

## Protecting Against Email Spoofing

Prevent spoofing through effective **email authentication** using three key technologies:

1. **[SPF (Sender Policy Framework)](/email-sending-concepts/spf)**  
   This technology lists the authorized sending servers for a domain and is published as a DNS record.

2. **[DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)](/email-sending-concepts/dkim)**  
   DKIM adds a digital signature to emails, allowing the recipient server to verify the authenticity of the message.

3. **[DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance)](/email-sending-concepts/dmarc)**  
   DMARC enhances SPF and DKIM by guiding receivers on how to handle unauthenticated messages and providing reports to domain owners.

To protect your domain, follow these steps:

1. **Discovery:** Identify all legitimate email sources for your domain.
2. **Deployment:** Implement SPF and DKIM, and initiate DMARC in "monitor" mode.
3. **Enforcement:** Gradually tighten your policies to **reject unauthenticated messages**.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Email Spoofing

### Can small businesses afford to implement anti-spoofing protections?
Yes. SPF and DKIM are often free to set up, and basic DMARC monitoring tools are available at no cost. The investment is minimal compared to the potential losses.

### How can I tell if an email is spoofed?
Check if the email address matches the sender's name. Look for urgent requests, unexpected links, or unusual tone. Most clients show warnings if SPF/DKIM/DMARC fail.

### Is email spoofing illegal?
Yes, using spoofing for fraud or harm is illegal in most countries. Testing email systems with spoofing is only legal when properly authorized.
