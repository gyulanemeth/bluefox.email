# Deliverability

**Email deliverability** is the measure of how successful an email is at reaching recipients' inboxes rather than being filtered to spam folders or blocked entirely. Unlike delivery rate (which only tracks whether an email was accepted by the receiving server), deliverability specifically focuses on **inbox placement** and reflects the overall health of your email sending program.

## What is Deliverability?

It represents the complex interplay between technical configurations, sending behavior, and recipient engagement that determines where your emails land. While delivery simply means an email was accepted by the receiving mail server without a [bounce](/email-sending-concepts/bounces), **true deliverability means landing in the inbox** where recipients can actually see and engage with your messages.

In today's sophisticated email ecosystem, major mailbox providers like Gmail, Yahoo, and Microsoft use extensive filtering algorithms that evaluate hundreds of factors before deciding where to place incoming emails. These decisions happen in milliseconds and are based on technical signals like proper [authentication](/email-sending-concepts/email-authentication), behavioral patterns in your sending history, and how recipients have interacted with your previous messages.

## Key Factors Affecting Deliverability

Email deliverability depends on four fundamental pillars that work together to establish your sending reputation:

| Factor | Description | Key Components |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Sender Authentication** | Technical foundation proving sender identity | [SPF](/email-sending-concepts/spf), [DKIM](/email-sending-concepts/dkim), [DMARC](/email-sending-concepts/dmarc) protocols |
| **Infrastructure Quality** | Technical setup supporting email sending | Dedicated IPs, [DNS records](/email-sending-concepts/dns), [TLS](/email-sending-concepts/tls), clean IP neighborhoods |
| **Sender Reputation** | Sending history as evaluated by receiving systems | [Bounce rates](/email-sending-concepts/bounce-rate), [complaint rates](/email-sending-concepts/complaints), spam trap hits, blocklists |
| **Recipient Engagement** | How recipients interact with your emails | Opens, clicks, replies, time reading emails, folder movements |

## Measuring and Monitoring Deliverability

Understanding your current deliverability status requires systematic monitoring across multiple dimensions:

Email Service Providers (ESPs) typically provide **delivery rate metrics** that track messages accepted versus bounced, but these numbers don't reveal how many messages reached the inbox versus spam folders. For true deliverability insight, **seed list testing** and **panel-based monitoring** are essential. Seed tests send emails to a known set of test accounts across different providers to measure inbox placement, while panel data aggregates real recipient behavior to provide broader insights. Many providers like AWS offer [delivery notifications](/aws-concepts/delivery-notifications) that inform senders about successful deliveries in near real-time.

**Engagement analytics** serve as important indirect deliverability indicators. Sudden drops in open rates may signal inbox placement issues, especially when isolated to specific mailbox providers. For [Gmail users](/email-sending-concepts/complaints#what-are-complaints) in particular, engagement metrics strongly influence future deliverability, creating a cycle where poor initial placement leads to lower engagement and even worse placement over time.

Maintaining visibility into email [authentication](/email-sending-concepts/email-authentication) status is also critical. Tools like DMARC reporting provide insights into whether your messages are properly authenticated, helping identify potential vulnerabilities before they impact deliverability.

## Common Deliverability Challenges

Several common issues frequently disrupt email deliverability:

- **Poor list practices** – Purchased lists, missing double opt-in, and infrequent list cleaning lead to high bounce rates and poor engagement, damaging sender reputation.

- **Authentication failures** – Missing or misconfigured SPF, DKIM or DMARC records signal potential fraud to mailbox providers, causing immediate filtering.

- **Content issues** – Spam-like terms, misleading subject lines, image-heavy emails, and broken HTML trigger content filters even when technical setup is perfect.

- **Inconsistent sending patterns** – Sudden volume spikes, erratic schedules, or abrupt content changes disrupt established reputation patterns and activate defensive filtering mechanisms.

## Improving Email Deliverability

Enhancing deliverability requires implementing a **robust technical foundation** through complete email authentication with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records, along with proper DNS configuration including [MX records](/email-sending-concepts/mx-record) and reverse DNS lookups. When using cloud email services like AWS SES, configure appropriate [delivery policies](/aws-concepts/delivery-policy) to manage message retries and delivery attempts. Focus on **strategic list management** with confirmed opt-in processes, engagement segmentation, and sunset policies for inactive subscribers while maintaining low **bounce rates** (below 2%) and **complaint rates** (below 0.1%). Create **engagement-focused content** with personalization, mobile optimization, and A/B testing to maintain strong engagement metrics. Implement **progressive sending practices** like IP warming, volume ramping, and cohort-based sending, with proper feedback loops and bounce handling systems to adapt quickly to reputation signals.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Email Deliverability

### What's the difference between delivery and deliverability?

Delivery means an email was accepted by the receiving server without generating a bounce, while deliverability specifically refers to inbox placement rather than spam folder placement. An email can have perfect delivery (no bounces) but poor deliverability (most messages going to spam).

### Do email authentication protocols guarantee inbox placement?

No, authentication is necessary but not sufficient for good deliverability. While SPF, DKIM, and DMARC verify message legitimacy, inbox placement also depends on sender reputation, content quality, and recipient engagement.

### How long does it take to fix poor deliverability?

Depending on the severity of issues, deliverability recovery can take anywhere from a few days to several months. Technical fixes can be implemented quickly, but rebuilding damaged sender reputation often requires prolonged demonstration of improved sending practices.
