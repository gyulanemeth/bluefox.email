# SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

**SPF** stands for **Sender Policy Framework**.

It is an email authentication method that allows domain owners to **specify which mail servers are authorized to send emails** on behalf of their domain.

SPF helps prevent **email spoofing** by giving receiving mail servers a way to check whether a message claiming to come from a domain actually comes from an allowed IP address.

## üîç How SPF Works

1. A mail server receives an email claiming to be from `example.com`
2. It looks up the **SPF record** (a TXT record) in DNS for `example.com`
3. The SPF record lists authorized sending IP addresses or domains
4. The receiving server checks whether the sender's IP is in that list
5. Based on the result, it marks the email as `pass`, `fail`, `softfail`, `neutral`, etc.

## üìÅ Example SPF Record

```txt
example.com. IN TXT "v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 include:mailprovider.com -all"
```

- `ip4:192.0.2.0/24` ‚Üí allow this IP range to send mail
- `include:mailprovider.com` ‚Üí include another domain's SPF records
- `-all` ‚Üí **fail everything else** (reject unauthorized senders)

## Understanding SPF Qualifiers

SPF uses qualifiers to indicate how receiving servers should handle email from different sources:

| Qualifier | Symbol | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Pass | `+` | Authorized sender | Accept the message |
| Fail | `-` | Unauthorized sender | Reject the message |
| SoftFail | `~` | Probably unauthorized | Accept but mark (often to spam) |
| Neutral | `?` | No policy statement | Accept the message |

For example, `-all` at the end of an SPF record means "fail all other senders" (strongest protection), while `~all` means "softfail all other senders" (less strict).

## Common SPF Mechanisms

SPF records can contain several mechanisms to define authorized senders:

- `a` - Authorizes the A record(s) for the domain
- `mx` - Authorizes the MX record(s) for the domain
- `ip4:` - Authorizes IPv4 addresses or ranges
- `ip6:` - Authorizes IPv6 addresses or ranges
- `include:` - Authorizes another domain's SPF records
- `exists:` - Tests if a specified domain resolves to any IP address
- `all` - Matches everything (usually with a qualifier)

## The Importance of SPF for Email Deliverability

Implementing SPF provides several key benefits:

1. **Reduced spoofing**: Prevents unauthorized use of your domain in the From address
2. **Improved deliverability**: Many email providers check SPF before accepting messages
3. **Better sender reputation**: Helps maintain your domain's email reputation
4. **DMARC compliance**: Required component for a complete [DMARC](/email-sending-concepts/dmarc) policy

## SPF Limitations and Best Practices

While SPF is important, it does have some limitations to be aware of:

- **Forwarding issues**: Email forwarding can cause SPF failures
- **10 DNS lookup limit**: SPF specifications limit records to 10 DNS lookups
- **No content protection**: SPF only authenticates the envelope sender, not the message content
- **Domain vs. display name**: SPF doesn't protect against display name spoofing

To implement SPF effectively:

1. Start with a permissive policy (`~all`) for testing
2. Monitor carefully before moving to a strict policy (`-all`)
3. Keep records under 10 DNS lookups
4. Combine SPF with [DKIM](/email-sending-concepts/dkim) and [DMARC](/email-sending-concepts/dmarc) for complete protection

## ‚úÖ TL;DR

| SPF stands for | **Sender Policy Framework** |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Used for | Specifying authorized mail servers |
| Type of DNS record | `TXT` record on your domain |
| Helps protect against | Email spoofing |
| Works with | DKIM, DMARC, DNS |

By implementing SPF alongside other email authentication methods, you create a strong foundation for email security and deliverability. BlueFox Email helps ensure your email authentication is properly configured to maximize your email sending success.
