When setting up email for your business, SPF is one of the first authentication methods you should implement. While it may seem like a technical detail, SPF directly impacts your email deliverability and brand protection. I've seen many organizations struggle with deliverability issues simply because they overlooked proper SPF configuration. Even seemingly minor mistakes in your SPF record can lead to legitimate emails being blocked or flagged as spam, particularly when sending to corporate email systems that enforce strict authentication policies.

## <a id="what-is-spf"></a>What is SPF?

SPF, or Sender Policy Framework, is an email authentication protocol that lets domain owners specify which mail servers are authorized to send emails on their behalf. It works by creating a DNS TXT record that lists all authorized sending sources.

When properly implemented, SPF serves as your domain's "guest list" for email sending privileges. Just as a bouncer checks IDs against a guest list, receiving mail servers check incoming emails against your SPF record to determine if the sending server is authorized to use your domain name.

## <a id="how-does-spf-work"></a>How Does SPF Work?

SPF enables receiving mail servers to confirm if an incoming email originates from an IP address authorized by the sender's domain. This verification occurs seamlessly behind the scenes with every email sent. Though it may sound technical, it's a quick and efficient process, taking just a fraction of a second. The primary aim is to guarantee that emails appearing to come from your domain are genuinely sent by sources you've authorized.

Here's a clear breakdown of how SPF works during email delivery:

1. **Sending**: When an email is dispatched, the sending server introduces itself through the envelope sender address, often referred to as the return-path.

2. **Receiving**: The receiving mail server extracts the domain from this return-path.

3. **DNS Lookup**: Next, it conducts a DNS lookup on the sender’s domain to locate the SPF record, which is a TXT record.

4. **Policy Check**: The recipient server then compares the sending IP address against the list of authorized IPs detailed in that SPF record.

5. **Verdict**: Based on this comparison, the server assigns an SPF status, which could be `pass`, `fail`, `softfail`, `neutral`, `none`, `permerror`, or `temperror`.

When an email is sent from someone@example.com, the receiving server verifies the SPF record of example.com to determine if the sending server's IP address is permitted to send emails on its behalf.

SPF records are held in your domain's DNS as TXT records and adhere to a specific format. A standard SPF record may appear as follows:

```
v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 include:thirdparty.com include:_spf.google.com ~all

```

Let's break this down:

- **`v=spf1`**: This signifies that the record is using SPF version 1.
  
- **`ip4:192.0.2.0/24`**: This authorizes all IP addresses within the specified IPv4 range.

- **`include:thirdparty.com`**: This allows servers listed in the SPF record of thirdparty.com to send emails on your behalf.

- **`include:_spf.google.com`**: This grants authorization to Google's servers, which are typically used for Google Workspace email.

- **`~all`**: This applies a softfail policy to any server not included in the previous specifications.

This structure serves as a guide for receiving servers on how to process emails that appear to originate from your domain. If an email does not comply with the SPF guidelines, it may be flagged as suspicious or rejected, depending on the recipient's handling of SPF failures.


## <a id="why-is-spf-important"></a>Why is SPF Important?

The Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is essential for email authentication, as it effectively combats [email spoofing](/email-sending-concepts/email-spoofing.md) a common tactic in phishing and spam. By allowing domain owners to designate which IP addresses or mail servers can send emails for their domain, SPF empowers receiving mail servers to verify the legitimacy of incoming messages. This significantly lowers the risk of malicious entities impersonating your domain to distribute fraudulent emails, which can harm your brand's reputation and lead to security issues.

Moreover, implementing SPF enhances your domain's email deliverability. When your emails successfully pass SPF checks, they are more likely to land in recipients' inboxes rather than getting lost in spam folders. Over time, consistent SPF alignment builds a strong domain reputation, fostering trust with email service providers and boosting the effectiveness of your email marketing efforts.

While SPF alone does not safeguard the visible “From” address, it checks the envelope sender. It is a critical component of modern email security. For comprehensive protection, combine SPF with [DKIM](/email-sending-concepts/dkim) and [DMARC](/email-sending-concepts/dmarc.md) to ensure thorough authentication coverage.

## <a id="frequently-asked-questions-about-spf"></a>Frequently Asked Questions About SPF

<div class="dkim-faq">

<div class="faq-item">
<h3 class="question">What is the main purpose of SPF?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
      SPF (Sender Policy Framework) helps prevent spoofing by specifying which mail servers are allowed to send emails on behalf of your domain.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <h3 class="question">Does SPF protect the "From" address?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
      No. SPF checks the return-path (envelope sender), not the visible From address seen by recipients.
    </div>
</div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3 class="question">What happens if SPF fails?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
      If SPF fails, the receiving server may mark the message as spam, reject it, or ignore the result—depending on its local policy and DMARC settings.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3 class="question">Can SPF break email forwarding?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
      Yes. When an email is forwarded, the forwarder's IP may not be authorized in the original domain’s SPF record, causing SPF to fail unless SRS (Sender Rewriting Scheme) is used.
