# Domain Reputation

**Domain Reputation** refers to the perceived trustworthiness of a sending domain in the eyes of mailbox providers, ISPs, and anti-spam systems. It's a **critical factor** in determining whether your emails reach recipient's inboxes or get filtered to spam folders, directly impacting your overall [deliverability](/email-sending-concepts/deliverability) success.

## What is Domain Reputation?

Domain reputation is a score or rating assigned to your sending domain based on its historical email sending behaviors and recipient engagement patterns. Unlike [IP reputation](/email-sending-concepts/ip-reputation) which focuses on the sending server's address, domain reputation evaluates the trustworthiness of your actual domain name (e.g., yourbusiness.com) regardless of which servers or IPs are used to send emails.

## How Domain Reputation Works

Email receivers calculate domain reputation by continuously monitoring key metrics including authentication status ([SPF](/email-sending-concepts/spf), [DKIM](/email-sending-concepts/dkim), [DMARC](/email-sending-concepts/dmarc)), [spam complaints](/email-sending-concepts/complaints), engagement levels, [bounce rates](/email-sending-concepts/bounce-rate), and spam trap hits. This evaluation happens continuously and dynamically adjusts as your sending patterns and recipient interactions change. Each mailbox provider maintains its own proprietary scoring system, meaning your domain's reputation can vary across different receiving systems, with Gmail, Microsoft, Yahoo, and other major providers applying their own unique filtering algorithms.

| Factor | Impact on Domain Reputation |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Authentication Success** | Properly authenticated emails using [SPF](/email-sending-concepts/spf), [DKIM](/email-sending-concepts/dkim), and [DMARC](/email-sending-concepts/dmarc) strengthen domain reputation |
| **Spam Complaints** | High [complaint rates](/email-sending-concepts/complaints) significantly damage domain reputation |
| **Engagement Metrics** | Opens, clicks, and other positive interactions improve reputation |
| **Bounce Rates** | Excessive [hard bounces](/email-sending-concepts/hard-bounce) indicate poor list hygiene and harm reputation |
| **Spam Trap Hits** | Sending to spam traps causes severe reputation damage |
| **Content Quality** | Spammy content patterns can negatively affect reputation |

## Why is Domain Reputation Important?

Domain reputation has become the **cornerstone of email deliverability** because it provides a more persistent and comprehensive view of sender trustworthiness than IP-based metrics alone. Domain reputation follows your brand across different email sending platforms, giving mailbox providers a consistent way to evaluate your sending practices even when you change ESPs or use multiple sending services like [AWS SES](/aws-concepts/ses). It's increasingly weighted more heavily than IP reputation in filtering decisions by major mailbox providers, especially as shared IP sending becomes more common. Additionally, domain reputation is more difficult to manipulate or reset than IP reputation, encouraging long-term adherence to best practices rather than short-term fixes.

## Building and Maintaining Domain Reputation

Building a positive domain reputation requires **strategic implementation** focused on proper **authentication** ([SPF](/email-sending-concepts/spf), [DKIM](/email-sending-concepts/dkim), [DMARC](/email-sending-concepts/dmarc)), maintaining **strong list hygiene** by removing [hard bounces](/email-sending-concepts/hard-bounce) and practicing permission-based marketing, prioritizing **content that drives engagement**, maintaining **consistent sending volume** without sudden spikes, implementing **regular monitoring** of key metrics for early issue detection, and providing [one-click unsubscribe](/email-sending-concepts/one-click-unsubscribe) options to minimize complaint rates.

## Domain Reputation Monitoring

While mailbox providers don't publicly share their exact reputation scores, several indicators can help you assess your domain's standing:

- **Inbox Placement Tools**: Monitor delivery to inbox vs. spam folder to detect reputation changes.
- **Authentication Reports**: Track SPF or DKIM failures that may signal potential reputation issues.
- **Feedback Loop Data**: Information from [complaint](/email-sending-concepts/complaints) feedback loops provides direct reputation insights.
- **Postmaster Tools**: Google Postmaster Tools and Microsoft SNDS provide limited reputation data.
- **Third-Party Tools**: Services like ReturnPath, 250ok, and others offer domain reputation monitoring.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to build a domain reputation?
Building a positive domain reputation typically takes 4-8 weeks of consistent, positive sending behavior, though establishing strong reputation with major providers may require several months.

### Should I use subdomains for different types of email?
Using dedicated subdomains (e.g., marketing.yourdomain.com, transactional.yourdomain.com) helps isolate reputations for different sending purposes, protecting critical messages from cross-contamination.

### What's more important: IP reputation or domain reputation?
Both matter, but domain reputation has become increasingly dominant in filtering decisions at major providers. A strong domain reputation can sometimes overcome modest IP reputation issues, but rarely the reverse.
