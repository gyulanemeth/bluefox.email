# Domain Reputation

**Domain Reputation** refers to the perceived trustworthiness of a sending domain in the eyes of mailbox providers, ISPs, and anti-spam systems. It's a **critical factor** in determining whether your emails reach recipient's inboxes or get filtered to spam folders, directly impacting your overall [deliverability](/email-sending-concepts/deliverability) success.

## What is Domain Reputation?

Domain reputation is a score or rating assigned to your sending domain based on its historical email sending behaviors and recipient engagement patterns. Unlike [IP reputation](/email-sending-concepts/ip-reputation) which focuses on the sending server's address, domain reputation evaluates the trustworthiness of your actual domain name (e.g., yourbusiness.com) regardless of which servers or IPs are used to send emails.

## How Domain Reputation Works

Email receivers track and evaluate several factors associated with emails sent from your domain to calculate its reputation. This evaluation happens continuously and dynamically adjusts as your sending patterns and recipient interactions change over time.

| Factor | Impact on Domain Reputation |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Authentication Success** | Properly authenticated emails using [SPF](/email-sending-concepts/spf), [DKIM](/email-sending-concepts/dkim), and [DMARC](/email-sending-concepts/dmarc) strengthen domain reputation |
| **Spam Complaints** | High [complaint rates](/email-sending-concepts/complaints) significantly damage domain reputation |
| **Engagement Metrics** | Opens, clicks, and other positive interactions improve reputation |
| **Bounce Rates** | Excessive [hard bounces](/email-sending-concepts/hard-bounce) indicate poor list hygiene and harm reputation |
| **Spam Trap Hits** | Sending to spam traps causes severe reputation damage |
| **Content Quality** | Spammy content patterns can negatively affect reputation |

Domain reputation operates across various systems, with Gmail, Microsoft, Yahoo, and other major mailbox providers maintaining their own proprietary reputation databases and scoring methods.

## Why is Domain Reputation Important?

Domain reputation has become the **cornerstone of email deliverability** because it provides a more persistent and comprehensive view of sender trustworthiness than IP-based metrics alone. It offers several key advantages that make it essential for modern email marketing success:

Domain reputation follows your brand across different email sending platforms, giving mailbox providers a consistent way to evaluate your sending practices even when you change ESPs or use multiple sending services like [AWS SES](/aws-concepts/aws-ses). It's increasingly weighted more heavily than IP reputation in filtering decisions by major mailbox providers, especially as shared IP sending becomes more common. Additionally, domain reputation is more difficult to manipulate or reset than IP reputation, encouraging long-term adherence to best practices rather than short-term fixes.

## Building and Maintaining Domain Reputation

Establishing and preserving a positive domain reputation requires consistent adherence to email best practices:

- **Proper Authentication**: Implement and maintain [SPF](/email-sending-concepts/spf), [DKIM](/email-sending-concepts/dkim), and [DMARC](/email-sending-concepts/dmarc) records for your sending domain.
- **List Hygiene**: Regularly clean your lists, remove [hard bounces](/email-sending-concepts/hard-bounce), and practice **permission-based marketing** by only sending to recipients who have explicitly opted in.
- **Engagement Focus**: Prioritize content that drives recipient engagement and promptly remove chronically unengaged subscribers.
- **Consistent Volume**: Maintain relatively stable sending patterns rather than unpredictable spikes in volume.
- **Monitoring**: Track [bounce rates](/email-sending-concepts/bounce-rate), [complaint rates](/email-sending-concepts/complaints), and engagement metrics to detect potential issues early.
- **User-Friendly Unsubscribe**: Implement [one-click unsubscribe](/email-sending-concepts/one-click-unsubscribe) options to reduce spam complaints.

## Domain Reputation Monitoring

While mailbox providers don't publicly share their exact reputation scores, several indicators can help you assess your domain's standing:

- **Inbox Placement**: Significant shifts in inbox vs. spam folder delivery rates often indicate reputation changes.
- **Authentication Failures**: Increases in SPF or DKIM failures may signal potential reputation issues.
- **Feedback Loop Data**: Information from [complaint](/email-sending-concepts/complaints) feedback loops provides direct reputation insights.
- **Third-Party Tools**: Services like ReturnPath, 250ok, and others offer domain reputation monitoring.
- **Postmaster Tools**: Google Postmaster Tools and Microsoft SNDS provide limited reputation insights.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to build a domain reputation?
Building a positive domain reputation typically takes 4-8 weeks of consistent, positive sending behavior. However, establishing a strong reputation with major mailbox providers may take several months of demonstrated good practices.

### Can a bad domain reputation be fixed?
Yes, damaged domain reputation can be repaired, but it requires dedicated effort to identify and correct the underlying issues. Recovery typically takes longer than initial reputation buildingâ€”often 2-3 months of improved practices.

### Should I use subdomains for different types of email?
Using dedicated subdomains (e.g., marketing.yourdomain.com, transactional.yourdomain.com) can help isolate reputations for different sending purposes, protecting critical transactional messages from marketing-related reputation issues.

### What's more important: IP reputation or domain reputation?
Both matter, but domain reputation has become increasingly dominant in filtering decisions, especially at major providers like Gmail. A strong domain reputation can sometimes overcome modest IP reputation issues, but the reverse is less often true.
