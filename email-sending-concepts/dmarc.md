When implementing email authentication, DMARC represents the final and arguably most crucial layer. While [SPF](/email-sending-concepts/spf.md) and [DKIM](/email-sending-concepts/dkim.md) are valuable on their own, without DMARC, you're missing critical policy enforcement and visibility. From years of working with email programs, I've seen that domains without DMARC remain vulnerable even when other authentication methods are in place. Many email marketers delay DMARC implementation, thinking it's overly complex, but this often leads to deliverability challenges that could have been avoided.

## <a id="what-is-dmarc"></a>What is DMARC?

DMARC, which stands for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance, is a policy based on DNS that allows domain owners to dictate how email receivers should handle messages that do not pass SPF or DKIM checks. Additionally, it provides domain owners with reports on these failures, enabling them to track who is sending emails on their behalf, whether legitimately or otherwise.

To implement DMARC, you must publish a DMARC record in your domain's DNS as a TXT record at:
`_dmarc.yourdomain.com`

You can configure the policy as follows:

- **none**: No action will be taken; this option is for monitoring purposes only.
- **quarantine**: The message will be flagged as suspicious.
- **reject**: The message will be completely rejected.

## <a id="how-does-dmarc-work"></a>How Does DMARC Work?

DMARC operates by verifying the alignment between the visible "From" domain and the domains authenticated through SPF and/or DKIM. Here's a breakdown of the process that occurs each time an email is received:

1. **Lookup**: The recipient checks for a DMARC record in the sender's DNS (`_dmarc.example.com`).

2. **Alignment Check**: The system confirms whether the domain in the “From” address matches the domains authenticated by SPF and/or DKIM.

3. **Authentication Check**: It evaluates if the email successfully passes either SPF or DKIM, ensuring that the authenticated method aligns with the “From” domain.

4. **Policy Evaluation**: Depending on your DMARC policy (none, quarantine, or reject), the recipient determines the appropriate action:
   - Accept the message (none)
   - Redirect it to spam (quarantine)
   - Completely block it (reject)

5. **Reporting**: If configured, the receiving server will send reports (aggregate and/or forensic) back to the domain owner.

For instance, if an attempt is made to spoof invoice@example.com without the sending server being included in your SPF or without a valid DKIM signature, and your policy is set to p=reject, the email will be blocked.

## <a id="why-is-dmarc-important"></a>Why is DMARC Important?

DMARC is essential for protecting your domain from impersonation, phishing, and email spoofing. Without it, malicious actors can forge your domain in the “From” address, sending fraudulent emails that seem legitimate. While SPF and DKIM validate specific technical aspects, they do not ensure alignment with the domain visible to users, creating a vulnerability. DMARC addresses this by enforcing domain alignment, ensuring the visible sender matches authenticated sources, and allowing domain owners to control actions for messages that fail this check.

In addition to security, DMARC offers operational benefits. It fosters trust with email providers and recipients, enhancing deliverability and reducing the chances of emails being marked as spam. DMARC reports provide valuable insights into how your domain is utilized, showing who sends emails on your behalf and their authentication success. Given that phishing is a primary attack vector, DMARC is essential. It is a critical component of any email security and brand protection strategy, and many inbox providers now require it for high-volume senders or those wishing to display brand logos via BIMI.

## <a id="frequently-asked-questions-about-dmarc"></a>Frequently Asked Questions About DMARC

<div class="dkim-faq">
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3 class="question">Do I need DKIM if I already use SPF?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
      Yes. SPF verifies the server sending the message, but DKIM ensures the message hasn't been altered in transit. SPF can break when emails are forwarded, while DKIM provides cryptographic proof that the email content is authentic. Used together, they greatly improve your email’s trustworthiness and deliverability.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3 class="question">What happens if the DKIM check fails?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
      A failed DKIM check means the email signature doesn't match the content or domain, which could indicate tampering or misconfiguration. While a DKIM failure alone doesn’t guarantee rejection, it weakens your domain’s credibility, especially if DMARC is enforcing strict policies. Some receiving servers may mark the email as spam or block it altogether.

  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3 class="question">Can I have multiple DKIM selectors for one domain?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
      Absolutely. Multiple selectors allow you to manage different keys for various systems or rotate them without disrupting delivery. For instance, you might use one selector for your transactional emails and another for your marketing platform. Each selector points to its own DNS record with a unique public key.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3 class="question">Does forwarding emails affect DKIM?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
      Sometimes. If the email is forwarded but the content and headers remain intact, DKIM typically survives. However, some forwarders modify headers (like adding disclaimers), which can break the signature. This is one reason DKIM works best when combined with SPF and DMARC each can back the other up when one fails.
