# MX Records: How Email Knows Where to Go

MX records (Mail Exchange records) are a type of DNS record that serve as the internet's mail routing system. They tell email servers where to deliver messages for a specific domain, acting as addresses in the vast postal system of email delivery.

## What Is an MX Record?

An **MX record** is a specialized DNS (Domain Name System) entry that identifies the mail servers responsible for receiving email on behalf of a domain. When someone sends an email to `you@yourdomain.com`, the sender's email server queries DNS for MX records associated with `yourdomain.com` to determine where to deliver the message.

Think of MX records as the "mail forwarding address" for your domain - they don't handle email themselves but point to the servers that do.

## How MX Records Work

1. **Sender initiates email delivery** to recipient@example.com
2. **Sender's mail server performs DNS lookup** for MX records of example.com
3. **DNS returns one or more MX records** with mail server hostnames and priorities
4. **Sender's server connects to the recipient's mail server** based on priority values
5. **The recipient's mail server accepts the message** for delivery to the final inbox

Each MX record contains two critical pieces of information:
- **Priority value** (lower numbers indicate higher priority)
- **Mail server hostname** that will accept email for the domain

## Anatomy of an MX Record

When looking up MX records using a DNS query tool like `dig` or `nslookup`, you'll see output like this:

```txt
example.com.  3600  IN  MX  10  mail1.example.com.
example.com.  3600  IN  MX  20  mail2.example.com.
```

Breaking down this record:
- `example.com.` - The domain these MX records apply to
- `3600` - TTL (Time To Live) in seconds before DNS resolvers should refresh this record
- `IN` - Internet class record
- `MX` - Record type (Mail Exchange)
- `10` - Priority value (lower numbers = higher priority)
- `mail1.example.com.` - Mail server hostname that will accept email

## MX Record Priority System

MX records use a priority system that enables redundancy and load balancing:

- **Lower priority values indicate preferred mail servers**
- **Higher priority values indicate backup mail servers**

For example, with these MX records:
```txt
example.com.  IN  MX  10  primary-mail.example.com.
example.com.  IN  MX  20  backup-mail.example.com.
```

Email servers will first try to deliver to `primary-mail.example.com`. If that server is unavailable, they'll attempt delivery to `backup-mail.example.com`.

## Multiple MX Records with Equal Priority

You can also configure multiple MX records with the same priority:

```txt
example.com.  IN  MX  10  mail1.example.com.
example.com.  IN  MX  10  mail2.example.com.
```

When multiple MX records share the same priority, sending mail servers typically choose one randomly, which can help distribute email load across multiple servers.

## Common MX Record Configurations

Different email providers use different MX record configurations:

### Google Workspace (formerly G Suite)
```txt
example.com.  IN  MX  1   aspmx.l.google.com.
example.com.  IN  MX  5   alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.
example.com.  IN  MX  5   alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.
example.com.  IN  MX  10  alt3.aspmx.l.google.com.
example.com.  IN  MX  10  alt4.aspmx.l.google.com.
```

### Microsoft 365
```txt
example.com.  IN  MX  0   example-com.mail.protection.outlook.com.
```

## Best Practices for MX Records

1. **Always have multiple MX records** with different priorities for redundancy
2. **Ensure your MX records point to valid hostnames** with A or AAAA records
3. **Use consistent TTL values** (typically 3600-86400 seconds)
4. **Regularly test your MX configuration** using DNS lookup tools
5. **Secure your mail servers** listed in MX records with proper authentication

## Common MX Record Issues

Several issues can arise with MX records that affect email delivery:

- **Missing MX records**: Without valid MX records, email delivery will fail
- **Incorrect priority settings**: Can cause delivery problems during outages
- **Mail loops**: When MX records create circular references
- **Outdated records**: When you've changed email providers but haven't updated MX records

## âœ… TL;DR: MX Records at a Glance

| MX stands for       | **Mail Exchange**                       |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Record type         | DNS TXT record                          |
| Purpose             | Direct incoming email to the correct mail servers |
| Key components      | Priority value and mail server hostname |
| Best practice       | Multiple records with different priorities for redundancy |
