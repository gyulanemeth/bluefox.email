# Email Deliverability

**Email Deliverability** refers to the ability to successfully deliver emails to recipients' inboxes rather than being blocked by email providers or routed to spam folders.

It encompasses all the factors that determine whether your email makes it to the intended inbox, including technical setup, sender reputation, and content quality.

## Difference Between Delivery and Deliverability

- **Delivery**: Whether an email was accepted by the receiving server (not bounced)
- **Deliverability**: Whether an email reached the inbox rather than the spam folder

An email can be successfully delivered (not bounced) but still have poor deliverability if it lands in the spam folder.

## Key Factors Affecting Email Deliverability

### 1. Technical Infrastructure

- **Authentication**: Proper SPF, DKIM, and DMARC setup
- **IP Reputation**: History and quality of the IP address you're sending from
- **Domain Reputation**: Sending history associated with your domain
- **Technical Setup**: Proper DNS records, MX records, etc.

### 2. Sender Behavior

- **Consistency**: Steady, predictable sending volume and frequency
- **List Hygiene**: Removing invalid or inactive email addresses
- **Segmentation**: Targeting content to relevant audience segments
- **Permission**: Only sending to recipients who explicitly opted in

### 3. Email Content and Structure

- **Spam Triggers**: Avoiding spammy words, excessive punctuation, and all-caps
- **Text-to-Image Ratio**: Maintaining a healthy balance of text to images
- **HTML Quality**: Clean, properly coded HTML without errors
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Emails that display properly on all devices

### 4. Recipient Engagement

- **Open Rate**: How many recipients open your emails
- **Click Rate**: How many recipients click links in your emails
- **Reply Rate**: How often recipients reply to your emails
- **Complaint Rate**: How often recipients mark your emails as spam

## Common Deliverability Issues

1. **Bounces**: Both hard bounces (permanent) and soft bounces (temporary)
2. **Spam Complaints**: Recipients marking your emails as spam
3. **Block Lists**: IP address or domain being added to industry blocklists
4. **Content Filters**: Getting caught in content-based spam filters
5. **Sender Reputation Issues**: Poor reputation with email providers

## Improving Email Deliverability

- Implement proper authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Maintain clean email lists by removing inactive subscribers
- Segment your audience for more targeted content
- Optimize email content to avoid spam triggers
- Focus on improving engagement metrics
- Warm up new IP addresses gradually
- Monitor deliverability metrics regularly
- Use feedback loops to reduce complaint rates
