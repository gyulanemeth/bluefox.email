# Click-through Rate (CTR)

**Click-through Rate (CTR)** is the percentage of recipients who clicked on one or more links in an email out of the total number of emails delivered.

It's a key metric for measuring the effectiveness and engagement level of an email campaign beyond just opens.

## How CTR is Calculated

Click-through rate is calculated using this formula:

```
CTR = (Number of Unique Clicks ÷ Number of Delivered Emails) × 100%
```

For example, if you send 1,000 emails, 950 are delivered, and 85 recipients click on links in your email, your CTR would be:

```
CTR = (85 ÷ 950) × 100% = 8.95%
```

## Different Types of CTR

Different email service providers might calculate CTR in slightly different ways:

1. **Unique CTR** - Counts each recipient only once, regardless of how many times they clicked on links in your email (most common).

2. **Total CTR** - Counts the total number of clicks, including multiple clicks from the same recipient. This metric will always be equal to or higher than unique CTR.

3. **Click-to-Open Rate (CTOR)** - Measures clicks as a percentage of opened emails, rather than delivered emails.
   ```
   CTOR = (Number of Unique Clicks ÷ Number of Unique Opens) × 100%
   ```

## Average CTRs

Average CTRs vary by industry, but typically range between 2-5% for most business emails. B2B emails often have slightly higher CTRs than B2C emails.

Factors affecting CTR include:

- Relevance of content to the audience
- Quality and placement of call-to-action (CTA) buttons
- Number and presentation of links
- Email design and mobile responsiveness
- Audience segment and targeting

## Improving CTR

Strategies to improve email CTR include:

- Using clear, compelling call-to-action buttons
- Ensuring links are visible and properly formatted
- Making emails mobile-responsive
- Segmenting your audience for more targeted content
- A/B testing different button designs, colors, and placements
- Keeping emails focused on a single main action
- Using personalization to make content more relevant

## Relationship with Other Metrics

CTR should be analyzed alongside other metrics for a complete picture:

- A high open rate with a low CTR may indicate compelling subject lines but disappointing content
- A low open rate with a high CTR suggests your audience is small but highly engaged
- CTR typically drops as email list size increases

## Summary
