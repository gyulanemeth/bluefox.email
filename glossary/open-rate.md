# Open Rate

**Open Rate** refers to the percentage of recipients who open an email out of the total number of emails delivered.

It is one of the most commonly tracked email marketing metrics and provides insight into the effectiveness of email subject lines and sender reputation.

## How Open Rate is Calculated

The open rate is calculated using this formula:

```
Open Rate = (Number of Emails Opened ÷ Number of Emails Delivered) × 100%
```

For example, if you send 1,000 emails, 900 are delivered (not bounced), and 180 are opened, your open rate would be:

```
Open Rate = (180 ÷ 900) × 100% = 20%
```

## How Email Opens Are Tracked

Email opens are typically tracked using a tiny, invisible tracking pixel (a 1×1 transparent GIF or PNG) embedded in the email. When this image loads, it signals to the email service provider that the email has been opened.

## Limitations of Open Rate Tracking

Open rates are not always accurate for several reasons:

1. **Image Blocking**: If a recipient has disabled automatic image loading in their email client, the tracking pixel won't load, and the open won't be counted.

2. **Preview Panes**: Some email clients show a preview of emails, which can trigger the tracking pixel even if the recipient didn't intentionally open the email.

3. **Privacy Protection**: Apple's Mail Privacy Protection (introduced in iOS 15) pre-loads images, including tracking pixels, making it appear as if all emails have been opened.

4. **Text-Only Emails**: Opens can't be tracked in plain-text emails that don't support image loading.

## Average Open Rates

Average open rates vary by industry, but typically range between 15-25% for most business emails. Factors affecting open rates include:

- Email subject line effectiveness
- Sender name recognition
- Timing of sending
- Email list quality
- Industry and audience type

## Improving Open Rates

Some strategies to improve email open rates include:

- Writing compelling, clear subject lines
- A/B testing different subject lines
- Sending from a recognizable name
- Using preheader text effectively
- Segmenting your email list for more targeted content
- Finding the optimal sending time for your audience
- Regular list cleaning to remove inactive subscribers
