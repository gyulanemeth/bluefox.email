Personalization in email marketing refers to the strategy of tailoring emails to individual recipients based on the data you've collected about them. It's about creating a more relevant and engaging experience for your subscribers, which can lead to higher open rates, click-through rates, and conversions.

Key aspects of personalization in email marketing include:

1. **Personalized Greetings**: Using the recipient's name in the email greeting or subject line can help grab their attention and make the email feel more personal and relevant.

2. **Segmentation**: By dividing your email list into smaller groups based on attributes like age, location, purchase history, or interests, you can send more targeted and personalized emails to each group.

3. **Dynamic Content**: This involves changing parts of the email content based on the recipient's data. For example, you could change the products you feature based on what the recipient has previously purchased or shown interest in.

4. **Behavior-Based Emails**: Sending emails based on the recipient's behavior, such as a follow-up email after a purchase or a reminder email for an abandoned shopping cart, can provide a highly personalized experience.

5. **Personalized Recommendations**: By leveraging data on each recipient's past behavior, you can provide personalized product or content recommendations that are likely to be of interest to them.

6. **Email Automation**: You can use automation to send personalized emails at the right time, such as a welcome email immediately after someone subscribes to your list or a birthday email on each subscriber's birthday.

In essence, personalization helps make your emails more relevant and engaging, leading to better results from your email marketing campaigns.
