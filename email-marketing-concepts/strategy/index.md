An email marketing strategy is a set of procedures and techniques that a company uses to send promotional messages directly to its audience via email. It outlines the way businesses plan and execute marketing activities through email to achieve their goals, such as driving more sales, increasing customer loyalty, or improving brand awareness. 

The key components of an email marketing strategy include:

1. **Goal Setting**: Identify what you want to achieve with your email marketing efforts. This could be increasing brand awareness, driving more website traffic, boosting sales, or nurturing customer relationships.
2. **Audience Segmentation**: Divide your email list into smaller, more targeted segments based on factors like demographics, past purchase history, and how they interacted with your previous emails. This enables you to send more personalized and relevant emails to your subscribers.
3. **Email Design and Content Creation**: Decide on the layout, images, and language that you will use in your emails. This should align with your brand and be consistent across all your emails. The content should be engaging, relevant, and offer value to the recipient.
4. **Personalization**: Personalizing your emails can significantly improve engagement. This could be as simple as addressing the recipient by their name, or more complex like providing product recommendations based on past purchases.
5. **Testing**: Test different aspects of your email (like subject lines, content, and send times) to see what gets the best response from your audience. Use A/B testing to continuously optimize your emails.
6. **Performance Tracking and Analysis**: Use email marketing tools to track key metrics such as open rates, click-through rates, conversion rates, and bounce rates. This information can help you understand what's working and what's not in your strategy and make necessary adjustments.
7. **Automation**: Use email marketing automation tools to automatically send emails based on triggers like sign-ups, completed purchases, or abandoned carts.
8. **Compliance**: Make sure your email marketing strategy is compliant with email laws and regulations such as the CAN-SPAM Act or GDPR. This includes getting consent before emailing, allowing users to easily unsubscribe, and protecting user data.

Remember, the key to a successful email marketing strategy is maintaining a focus on the customer. Every email should offer value, and every strategy should be geared towards building a strong relationship with your audience.
