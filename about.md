# About

Hello! I'm Gyula NÃ©meth (GYN), the founder of bluefox.email.

![Me](/assets/me.png)

I have been working on the weird and quirky world of HTML emails since 2013, when I co-founded a company that focusing on email design related products.

All of these products core strength is that you can create pixel-perfect designs, and the emails created will look good in every email client.

As a CTO, while I have led the creation of three SaaS products, with a primary focus on emails, I observed many issues that still needed to be resolved. That's why I decided to build bluefox.email, that is focusing on SaaS companies' email issues.
