# About

Hello! I'm Gyula NÃ©meth (GYN), the founder of bluefox.email.

I've been working in the unique and challenging world of HTML emails since 2013, when I co-founded a company focused on email design products.

The core strength of all these products is that you can create pixel-perfect designs, and the emails created will look good in every email client.

As a CTO, while leading the creation of three SaaS products with a primary focus on emails, I noticed many issues that still needed to be resolved. That's why I decided to build bluefox.email, a platform dedicated to solving SaaS companies' email challenges.

This app focuses on marketing teams that take emails seriously. The feature I'm most proud of is the real-time collaborative email editor.
