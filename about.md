# About

Hello! I'm the creator of bluefox.email.

![Me](/assets/me.png)

I've been passionately immersed in the email industry for over 10 years, specializing in the technical elements that make email marketing tools powerful and user-friendly.

Over the years, I've had the privilege of contributing to the development of drag and drop email designers and content management platforms. My experience goes beyond just the technical aspects as I've been actively involved in business strategy, shaping the course of the products I've worked on.

Currently, my primary projects include [chamaileon.io](https://chamaileon.io/) and [Email Hero](https://emailhero.io/), both of which represent the culmination of my experience and dedication to the email field.

The creation of bluefox.email stems from a longstanding desire to build an Email Service Provider (ESP). For me, it represents not just a technical challenge but also an opportunity to create a product that stands out in terms of usability.

Despite my extensive involvement in the technical aspects of email, I acknowledge there are areas of email marketing I'm still exploring. As I embark on this journey of building bluefox.email, I intend to learn more about these areas, enriching both the software and my understanding of the industry.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bluefoxemail) to stay updated as I share my learnings along the way. Here's to crafting the future of email, one message at a time.
