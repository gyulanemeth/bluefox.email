# About

Hello! I'm Gyula Németh, the founder of BlueFox Email.

![Me](/assets/me.webp)

I’ve been working in the unusually difficult world of HTML email design and rendering since 2013, when I co-founded a company focused on email design products. For more than a decade, I’ve helped teams create **pixel-perfect email HTML that renders properly everywhere, including Outlook.**

As CTO, I led the creation of multiple SaaS products built around serious email production. Over the years, I noticed the same problems coming up again and again, especially for agencies managing email for multiple clients. BlueFox Email exists to solve those problems.

**Products I’ve built (and still actively develop):**

 - ***[edmdesigner.com](https://edmdesigner.com)*** The first embeddable email editor plugin you could integrate into your own SaaS. Our email HTML became known as **some of the best in the market, and it still is today.**

 - ***[chamaileon.io](https://chamaileon.io)*** A full email editor and collaboration platform used by marketing teams. I’m especially proud of building the **real-time collaborative email editor**, something very rare in the email space.

 - ***[emailhero.io](https://emailhero.io)***  A platform designed for major digital publishers. It helps teams manage **hundreds of brands and thousands of newsletters** with ease.

After working with rendering issues, design systems, Outlook quirks, dark mode challenges, and deliverability constraints for so many years, I decided to build BlueFox Email specifically for **marketing agencies**, the people who deal with these problems every single day.
