# Quick Start to BlueFox Email

Welcome to BlueFox Email! This guide will walk you through everything you need to get started - from creating your account to sending your first emails. Follow these steps to get up and running quickly.

## Step 1: Create Your BlueFox Email Account

Head over to [BlueFox Email](https://bluefox.email) and sign up for a new account. Fill in the required information and verify your email address to complete the registration process.


## Step 2: Create a Project

Now that you have an account, log in to the BlueFox Email. Here you will be presented with BlueFox Email's dashboard. Click on "Create Project" to set up your first email project. Although by default, a sample project named "Sample project" is created for you upon signing up, you can choose to create a new project if you wish. 

Keep in mind that each project when created is in "Sandbox Mode" by default. This means you can only send emails to verified email addresses. To send emails to unverified addresses, you will need to request for production access, more on that later.

To learn more about these delivery modes, check out this [documentation page](/docs/projects/delivery-modes.md).

Here, when you create a project you will be provided with basic email themes to choose from. You can select one of these themes to get started quickly, or you can customize your own email theme later.

## Step 3: Create your first email.

Next up, lets create your first email. Navigate to campaigns section of your project and click on "Create". Here you will be presented with three options. 

- **Create from Stratch**: This option allows you to create a new email campaign from scratch using BlueFox Email's email editor.
- **Use Template**: This option allows you to choose from a variety of pre-designed email templates to quickly create your email campaign.
- **Copy/Paste**: This option allows you to copy any existing campaign or email from your project to create a new one.

For this guide, we will choose the "Use Template" option. Select a template that suits your needs and customize it using the email editor. You can modify every element to match your brand and message.

You will need to fill some basic details like Name, Subject, Preview Text, Subscriber list etc., before you can proceed to the email editor. Once you are done customizing your email, don't forget to save your changes.

More on Subscriber lists can be found in [this documentation page](/docs/projects/contacts.md), as this is not the scope of this guide.

With that, your first email is ready to be sent!


## Step 4: Sending your first test email.

Before sending your email to your entire contact list, it's a good idea to send a test email to yourself first. This allows you to see how the email looks in your inbox and make any necessary adjustments. To send a test email, navigate to the email campaign you just created and click on the "Send Test Email" button. Enter your email address and hit send. Check your inbox to see how the email appears and make any changes if needed.

Here you can send to an email address of your choice, or you can choose a private subscriber list to send to.

:::warning 
Remember, Your project is still in Sandbox Mode, you can only send test emails to verified email addresses. Make sure to verify any email addresses you want to send test emails to before proceeding. You can find how to verify email addresses in [this documentation page](/docs/projects/delivery-modes.md).
