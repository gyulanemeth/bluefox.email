# Quick Start to BlueFox Email

Welcome to BlueFox Email! This guide walks you through everything you need to get started from creating your account to sending your first campaign. Follow the steps below to get up and running quickly.

## Step 1: Create Your BlueFox Email Account

<video width="800" height="450" loops muted autoplay controls playsinline>

</video>

Head over to [BlueFox Email](https://app.bluefox.email/accounts/create-account) and sign up for a new account. Fill in the required information and verify your email address to complete the registration process. Once your account is created, log in to access the BlueFox Email dashboard.

When you log in for the first time, you’ll be greeted with a welcome screen that outlines a set of recommended setup tasks. You can either follow these steps or skip them and explore the platform on your own.

You’ll also notice that a project named **“Sample project”** is created automatically. You can use this project to explore BlueFox Email’s features or create a new project if you prefer.

:::warning Sandbox Mode
Every project is created in **Sandbox Mode** by default. In this mode, you can only send emails to a limited set of verified email addresses.

To send emails to non-verified addresses, you’ll need to request production access. This is covered later in the guide.

Learn more about delivery modes in this [documentation page](/docs/projects/delivery-modes.md).
:::

At this point, you already have everything you need to send your first test email. Let’s do that next.


## Step 2: Sending Your First Test Email

  <source src="./quick-start-to-bluefox-email/Send test email.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

Before sending an email to your entire audience, it’s recommended to send a test email first. This allows you to preview how the email looks in your inbox and make any necessary adjustments.

To send a test email, open the email campaign you created and click **Send Test Email**. Enter an email address and send the test. Check your inbox and refine the content if needed.

You can send a test email to:
- A specific email address, or
- A private subscriber list

:::warning
Since your project is still in **Sandbox Mode**, test emails can only be sent to verified email addresses. Make sure to verify any address you want to use for testing.

You can learn how to verify email addresses in this [documentation page](/docs/projects/delivery-modes.md).
:::


And voilà! You’ve successfully created and sent your first email using BlueFox Email.

This guide covers only the essentials to help you get started quickly. There’s much more you can explore to enhance your email marketing efforts.

The next logical steps include:
- Configuring your domain  
- Requesting production access  
- Adding contacts
- Sending emails to your full audience  

Before doing all that, it’s recommended to personalize a few project settings first. Let’s start with those.


## Step 3: Subscription Preferences Page

<!-- <video width="800" height="450" loops muted autoplay controls playsinline>
  <source src="./quick-start-to-bluefox-email/Subscription Preferences Page.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video> -->

BlueFox Email provides a subscription preferences page where subscribers can manage their email subscriptions, such as opting out of specific lists.

For this page to be meaningful, subscribers need to clearly understand:
- Which brand the emails are coming from  
- Which lists they’re subscribed to  
- What each list represents  

Start by navigating to **Project Settings**. In the main tab, set a proper project name and upload your brand logo. This information appears on the subscription preferences page.

Next, go to the **Contacts** section and create or edit your subscriber lists. Make sure each list has a clear name and description, as this information is also shown to subscribers.

That’s it your subscription preferences page is now personalized.


## Step 4: Email Theme Settings

<!-- <video width="800" height="450" loops muted autoplay controls playsinline>
  <source src="./quick-start-to-bluefox-email/Email Theme Settings.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video> -->

Next, let’s personalize your email themes. Navigate to the your project's **Email Themes** section of your project.

You’ll see a default theme that includes colors, fonts, images, links, etc . We recommend customizing this theme to match your brand identity.

Click **Edit** to modify the theme. You can update colors, fonts, logos, and more. Once saved, this theme will be applied to all email campaigns by default.

For this tutorial, we will also change 


## Step 5: Configure Your Domain

<!-- <video width="800" height="450" loops muted autoplay controls playsinline>
  <source src="./quick-start-to-bluefox-email/Domain Configuration.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video> -->

Configuring your domain is essential for good email deliverability. Emails sent from a verified domain are more likely to reach inboxes and less likely to be marked as spam.

To configure your domain, go to **Project Settings** then **Verified Domains** tab and click **Create**. Enter your domain name and select the appropriate region.

BlueFox Email will generate authentication records such as **DKIM**, **SPF**, and **DMARC**, it is highly recommended to set up all of them. Add these records to your domain’s DNS settings.

## Step 6: Request Production Access

<!-- <video width="800" height="450" loops muted autoplay controls playsinline>
  <source src="./quick-start-to-bluefox-email/Request Production Access.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video> -->

While in Sandbox Mode, you can only send emails to verified addresses. To remove this limitation, you must request production access.

Go to **Project Settings** then **Delivery Mode** tab and click **Apply for Production Access**. Provide details about your email-sending use case and practices.

The BlueFox Email team will review your request. Once approved, your project will move to **Production Mode**, allowing you to send emails to any address without restrictions.

Learn more about delivery modes here: [Delivery Modes](/docs/projects/delivery-modes.md).

## Step 7: Add Your Contacts

<!-- <video width="800" height="450" loops muted autoplay controls playsinline>
  <source src="./quick-start-to-bluefox-email/Add Contacts.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video> -->

Before sending emails to your audience, you need to add contacts to your project.

Navigate to the **Contacts** section and click **Add Contacts**. You can:
- Add contacts manually, or  
- Import them from a CSV file  

To keep your audience organized and improve targeting, group contacts into subscriber lists. You can also segment contacts based on various criteria to send more personalized and relevant emails.

:::tip 
The larger and more detailed your contact database, the more effectively you can segment your audience—and the better results you’ll achieve from your email campaigns.
