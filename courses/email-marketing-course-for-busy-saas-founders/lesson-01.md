# Send Your First SaaS Newsletter

(TODO 60-90 SEC VIDEO HERE)

Early users don’t just want features, they want proof you’re alive and moving.  

---

Getting started with a newsletter is probably the easiest way to begin with email marketing. It has some clear benefits: it keeps you on top of your early users’ minds and shows them that you’re making progress. That’s especially important in the early days! You want your users to feel confident that *yes, we’re still working on the product and we’re not going anywhere*.  

Later, these newsletters can lay the foundation for automations, but their biggest value early on is building the habit. Email becomes part of your regular marketing activity, and more importantly, part of your product experience.  

The goal of this lesson is simple: send out your first newsletter, start building consistency, and make email communication a natural part of your SaaS.  


## Defining Your Lists

One email list is rarely enough. As your product grows, your users will receive different types of emails. It’s better to think about that early, but don’t worry, you can always adjust later.

First, let’s separate the two big email categories:
- **Transactional emails**: password resets, confirmations, or receipts. These are required and do not depend on lists.
- **Marketing or product emails**: updates, tips, onboarding emails, or newsletters. ***These do require lists.***

For marketing and product emails, you always need to offer a **global unsubscribe** option. That is non-negotiable. But it is also recommended to let users manage their preferences by list. If someone does not want product updates, they might still want notifications or onboarding tips. Giving them these options can reduce churn from your lists. Besides that, it's always a good practice to offer a **one-click unubscribe** option for every list.

**Example**  
- A **Notifications** list: "Someone sent you a message while your app was closed."
- A **Product Updates** list: "Here’s what’s new in the product this month."

Keep it simple for now, and expand later as your communication grows.
