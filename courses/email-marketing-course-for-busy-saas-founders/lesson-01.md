# Send Your First SaaS Newsletter

(TODO 60-90 SEC VIDEO HERE)

Early users don’t just want features, they want proof you’re alive and moving.  

---

Getting started with a newsletter is probably the easiest way to begin with email marketing. It has some clear benefits: it keeps you on top of your early users’ minds and shows them that you’re making progress. That’s especially important in the early days! You want your users to feel confident that *yes, we’re still working on the product and we’re not going anywhere*.  

Later, these newsletters can lay the foundation for automations, but their biggest value early on is building the habit. Email becomes part of your regular marketing activity, and more importantly, part of your product experience.  

The goal of this lesson is simple: send out your first newsletter, start building consistency, and make email communication a natural part of your SaaS.
