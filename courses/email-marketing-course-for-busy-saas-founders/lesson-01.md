# Send Your First SaaS Newsletter

Getting started with a newsletter is probably the easiest way of getting started with email marketing. It has some clear benefits, most importantly that you stay on the top of the minds of your early users, and you show progress to them. It is especially important, because you have to show that "yeah, we are still working on the product and not goin anywhere".

Later, these newsletters can lay the foundation of your automations, but more importantly, it can help you to build a habit. It helps to build consistency.

The goal of this lesson is to get started with a simple newsletter, and build up a habit that email marketing will be part of your marketing activities, and even more importantly, email communication will be part of your product.
