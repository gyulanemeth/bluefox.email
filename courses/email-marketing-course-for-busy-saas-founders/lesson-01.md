# Send Your First SaaS Newsletter

(TODO 60-90 SEC VIDEO HERE)

Early users don’t just want features, they want proof you’re alive and moving.  

---

Getting started with a newsletter is probably the easiest way to begin with email marketing. It has some clear benefits: it keeps you on top of your early users’ minds and shows them that you’re making progress. That’s especially important in the early days! You want your users to feel confident that *yes, we’re still working on the product and we’re not going anywhere*.  

Later, these newsletters can lay the foundation for automations, but their biggest value early on is building the habit. Email becomes part of your regular marketing activity, and more importantly, part of your product experience.  

The goal of this lesson is simple: send out your first newsletter, start building consistency, and make email communication a natural part of your SaaS.  


## Defining Your Lists

One list might not be enough... It's time to think about all of the different emails your users will receive. (Don't worry, you can apply changes later.)

What topics you wanna cover... don't worry, you can add new lists later.

Transactional emails are not tied to lists -> no problem here.

You will need to give the opportunity for your users to opt-out from your emails... It's required to make it possible to unsubscribe from all, but if you show them that there are specific lists for specific topics, they might stay signed up for a topic or two.

A quick example... You might have one list for "Notifications" (eg.: someone sent you a message while your app was not open), and one "Product Updates" (eg.: these newsletters).
