# No BS Email Marketing Course for Busy SaaS Founders

We live in crazy times, especially when it comes to marketing. Everything changes rapidly, algorithms shift daily, and more and more people are starting to use LLMs instead of search engines.

In this highly unpredictable environment, we need to do our best to mitigate risks, or even better: turn them to our advantage. We need to stay connected with our prospects and users.

And this is where email comes handy. Everyone has an email address, we basically use email as our unique ID. If you can get people to sign up to your list, you will have a very direct way to communicate with them.

Even though many people claim they don't read their email, in most of the cases it's not true, they are just overwhelmed by the amount of emails they get. You have to send the right messages to the right people at the right time to get their attention. (I know, it's not easy. But that is why you are reading this course, right?)

::: tip My wife says she doesn't read email. But guess what's the truth!
Here is a quick example I observed in my life. My wife said that she never reads emails, and she hates it. I was quite skeptical about it (not that she hates it, but that she doesn't read emails), so I started to observe if she really doesn't read email. It comes out not only she checks her email multiple times per day, she opens ALL of the marketing emails that are relevant to her, and provides value to her. (In our case, one example can be a coupon code on diapers, since we have two babies under two.)

Be assured that if someone signs up to your list, and you send relevant emails (you don't spam them), then most of them will read your emails.

**So, what can you expect from this course?**

We designed this course with busy SaaS founders in mind. The goal of the whole course is to set up a good email marketing framework, that you can use as a good starting point, and fine-tune it later.

The course consists of the following things:

1) free articles on the site
2) youtube videos (watch me explain + worksheets in use)
3) worksheets via newsletter (weekly homework for 6 weeks)

If you complete all of the homeworks every week, you should be able to set up a well-functioning email marketing machine in 6 weeks.

## Why email marketing matters for SaaS Growth

Throughout the user lifecycle, email plays a very, very important role. You can use email in most of the steps as your primary or secondary tool.

Let's see the lifecycle states of a user:

### Awareness

Awareness is when people first discover your brand or product exists.

Since we don't know these people's email addresses, we can't really use email in this stage (except for cold emails, but we don't cover that topic here), but we can use email as our primary channel of contact in ALL of the other user lifecycle stages!

### Acquisition

Acquisition is when you make people to sign up.

It can happen in various ways. For example, people search for a specific topic, find your site and the decide to sign up.

You can use **email indirectly** at this stage through **lead magnets**. A lead magnet is a free valuable resource that you offer to people in exchange for their contact info, usually their email address. The point is that you might be able to convert them into leads.

### Activation

Activation is getting a new user to their first moment of real value.

You can help users with **onboarding email flows** at this stage.

### Conversion

Conversion is when you turn leads or free users into paying customers.

You can use email for nurturing leads with educational content, trust building, and timely upgrade offers.

### Retention 

Retention is keeping existing customers engaged and coming back.

You can do a LOT with email to keep your users on board. For example, you can send feature updates, regular "how to get more value" emails, usage reminders & nudges, and many more.

### Expansion

Expansion is growing revenue from existing customers.

This can happen in two ways via email: you can send upgrade nudges (highlighting the extra benefits of the bigger plan) or upselling another product or service.

### Advocacy

Advocacy is when you turn happy customers into promoters.

Well, email does not have a lot of role here, but you can try to get testinonials in email.

### Reactivation

Reactivation is when you are bringing back churned or inactive customers.

You can set up re-engagement email sequences for this.


::: tip What we focus on in this course
In this course, we will talk about **activation** (lesson 2), **retention** (lesson 1, lesson 4, lesson 5), and **acquisition** (lesson 3, lesson 6).

## How Email Fits Into the Bigger Marketing Mix

If you think about content (SEO), social, and ads as getting attention, then you can think about email as **keeping attention**. It can also help you to move people through activation, conversion to retention phases and so on, as we saw in the previous section.

I can't emphasize enough how reliable channel email is. Social and search algos change so frequently and unpredictably that it's essential to have a reliable way of communicating with your prospects and customers. Email is a very direct way of communication. You just need to make sure that you send relevant content, and make it easy for them to unsubscribe. (Yes, you DON'T wanna spam people.)

Many people consider cold emails as part of email marketing, but we are not one of them. This course is not about cold emails. In our opinion, email marketing starts, when someone gives you their email address.
