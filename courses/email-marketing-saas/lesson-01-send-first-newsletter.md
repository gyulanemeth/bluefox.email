# Send Your First SaaS Newsletter

(TODO 60-90 SEC VIDEO HERE)

Early users don’t just want features, they want proof you’re alive and moving.  

---

Getting started with a newsletter is probably the easiest way to begin with email marketing. It has some clear benefits: it keeps you on top of your early users’ minds and shows them that you’re making progress. That’s especially important in the early days! You want your users to feel confident that *yes, we’re still working on the product and we’re not going anywhere*.  

Later, these newsletters can lay the foundation for automations, but their biggest value early on is building the habit. Email becomes part of your regular marketing activity, and more importantly, part of your product experience.  

The goal of this lesson is simple: send out your first newsletter, start building consistency, and make email communication a natural part of your SaaS.  


## Defining Your Lists

One email list is rarely enough. As your product grows, your users will receive different types of emails. It’s better to think about that early, but don’t worry, you can always adjust later.

First, let’s separate the two big email categories:
- **Transactional emails**: password resets, confirmations, or receipts. These are required and do not depend on lists.
- **Marketing or product emails**: updates, tips, onboarding emails, or newsletters. ***These do require lists.***

For marketing and product emails, you always need to offer a **global unsubscribe** option. That is non-negotiable. But it is also recommended to let users manage their preferences by list. If someone does not want product updates, they might still want notifications or onboarding tips. Giving them these options can reduce churn from your lists. Besides that, it's always a good practice to offer a **one-click unubscribe** option for every list.

**Example**  
- A **Notifications** list: "Someone sent you a message while your app was closed."
- A **Product Updates** list: "Here’s what’s new in the product this month."

Keep it simple for now, and expand later as your communication grows.

## Collecting Your First Contacts

Before you can send a newsletter, you need people to send it to. Start small: the goal is to build momentum, not a massive list overnight.  

Here are a few easy places to get your first contacts:  

- **Friends and colleagues**: the people who want to see you succeed.  
- **Beta users and early adopters**: they’re already invested in your product.  
- **Waitlists**: if you already have a waitlist, that’s basically your first list. Don’t start from scratch, invite those people to keep hearing from you as you move forward.  
- **Social channels**: share the signup link on your profiles or in relevant groups.  

If you add people who signed up for your product directly to a list, make sure you **mention it in your Terms & Conditions** and always make it easy to unsubscribe. Transparency is key to building trust.  

And don’t overcomplicate this step. You probably don’t need ads yet. Focus on the people who already know you or care about your product: that’s enough to get your first newsletter out the door.  


## Sending Your First Newsletter

Before we talk about the details, keep in mind that you must include an unsubscribe link. It's not only a law at many places, but common sense... you rather want people to unsubscribe than hitting the spam button, right?

Another thing... the first newsletter will not be perfect... but that's not a problem. The goal is to build a habit. Consistency is king!

### Choose a topic/ clear goal
 - progress announcements.... eg a monthly feature uptade is great (new feature, milesone, launch...)
 - share something useful/valuable (tip, resouce, story)
 - Invite to take action (try feature, reply with deedback, read docs.)
 - the newsletter should have 1 purpose, not five
 - probably the easiest is to start a monthly feature update newsletter.... it is also good for you, coz you think through what happened every month + it will make sure that you write docs properly (if needed) and you will work on some materials related to the new features that you can reuse elsewhere.

### Keep the content simple
 - write like you talk...
 - stick to the main topic (eg. feature/roadmap updates)
 - short paragraphs + headings
 - Simple CTA. Use buttons. (easier to see, easier to click and more importantly tap.)

### Craft the subject line
 - based on the content.
 - avoid spammy words (such as FREE, URGENT, !!!)
 - shorter is better: 5-8 words

### Sender name + email address
 - decide... personal / mascot / formal "XY App"
 - try not to use "no-reply" that will disappear in the inbox
 - your personal email / personal reply to -> you can easily ask users to reply (if you have the capacity)

### Design
 - make it sure that it looks good on mobile (and generally accross email clients)... (many might not know it, but it can be incredibly hard)
 - A simple on-brand template is fine.
 - If you include screenshots, don't put those into columns -> they would harder to see what's on the screenshot. Also, don't just do full-screen screenshots, but focus on the relevant parts.
 - include your logo & brand name + use consistent style with your other things, such as website (think about colors, typography, button stlyes, etc)
 - make sure your transactional and marketing emails (such as your newsletter) looks alike. It's always a bad impression to see totally different transactional & marketing / product emails

### Test send 
Very important!!!! Make sure you test the newsletter before you send it to your list. Just send a test send to yourself...

### Scheduling

Since many people get to many emails, timing is cricial.
Figure out a good time for your audience, and try to keep yourself to that time. (Timezones play and important role here.) Also, consider the day of the week.
Frequency is also important. Try to keep yourself to your schedule... eg monthly.

Now, schedule that newletter.
