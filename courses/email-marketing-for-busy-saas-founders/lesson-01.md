# Send Your First SaaS Newsletter

We live in crazy times, especially when it comes to marketing. Everything changes rapidly, algorighms change on a daily basis and people started using LLMs instead of search engines more and more.

Since we live in a highly unpredictable environment, we need to do our best to mitigate these risks, or even better, to use it to our advantage. We need to stay connected with our prospects. (TODO reformulate.)

And here comes email handy. Everyone has an email address, we basically use email as our unique ID. If you manage people to sign up to your email list, then you will have a very direct way to communicate with them.

Eventhough many people say, that they don't read their email, in most of the cases it's not true. You just have to send the right messages to the right people at the right time. (I know, it's not easy. But that it why you are reading this course, right?)

Here is a quick example I observed in my life. My wife said that she never reads emails, and she hates it. I was quite skeptical about it, so I started to observe if she really doesn't read email. It comes out not only she checks her email multiple times per day, she opens ALL of the marketing emails that are relevant to her, and provides value to her. (In our case, one example can be a coupon code on diapers, since we have two babies under two.)

Be assured that if someone signs up to your list, and you send relevant emails (you don't spam them), then most of them will read your emails.

So, what can you expect from this course?

We designed this course with busy SaaS founders in mind. The goal of the whole course is to set up a good email marketing framework, that you can use as a good starting point, and fine-tune it later.

The goal of this lesson is to get started with a simple newsletter, and build up a habit that email marketing will be part of your marketing activities, and even more importantly, email communication will be part of your product.
