faqs:
  - question: What's the difference between Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS?
    answer: SNS is a push-based messaging service that delivers messages to subscribers, while SQS is a queue-based messaging service that temporarily stores messages for consumers to pull. For email events, SNS is typically preferred as it enables immediate processing of time-sensitive notifications without polling.
  - question: What makes SNS suitable for handling email notifications?
    answer: SNS's architecture provides immediate delivery of notifications, supports multiple subscriber types for different processing needs, and offers filtering capabilities that allow you to route different types of email events to different handling systems, all critical features for responsive email operations.
  - question: Is SNS difficult to implement for email event handling?
    answer: No, SNS is designed for straightforward integration with SES. Basic setup requires minimal configuration, with the option to add more sophisticated filtering and routing as your needs evolve. Most email operations can be configured through the AWS console without writing custom code.

# Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)

Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed **publish/subscribe messaging service** that enables the decoupling of microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. In the context of email operations, SNS serves as the critical notification infrastructure for processing events like [bounces](/email-sending-concepts/bounces), [complaints](/email-sending-concepts/complaints), and deliveries, which are essential for maintaining good [deliverability](/email-sending-concepts/deliverability).

## What is Amazon SNS?

SNS is a **high-throughput, push-based messaging system** that can deliver messages to a variety of endpoints including Lambda functions, HTTP endpoints, email, SMS, and mobile push notifications. It acts as the communication backbone for [AWS SES](/aws-concepts/ses), allowing for real-time processing of email events.

The service follows a **publisher-subscriber model** where applications publish (send) messages to [topics](/aws-concepts/sns-topics), and [subscribers](/aws-concepts/sns-subscription) receive messages from topics they're subscribed to. This model enables **one-to-many communication** where a single notification can be processed by multiple systems simultaneously.

## How Amazon SNS Works with Email Systems

AWS SNS operates as a critical intermediary in email feedback systems. When an email event occurs in SES, such as a bounce or complaint, SES automatically publishes a notification message to a designated SNS topic. This **message publishing** process contains detailed information about the event, including recipient addresses, timestamps, and event-specific details.

Once published, the SNS topic **distributes copies of the message** simultaneously to all subscribed endpoints, ensuring rapid notification across multiple systems. This parallel distribution enables different parts of your infrastructure to react to email events concurrently without delays or dependencies.

The subscribers receiving these notifications, typically Lambda functions or SQS queues, then perform **event processing** tasks like updating suppression lists, logging analytics data, or triggering operational workflows. This processing happens in real-time, allowing immediate response to critical email events.

For sophisticated email operations, SNS also supports **message filtering** through subscription filter policies. These filters enable subscribers to receive only specific types of email events, such as separating [hard bounces](/email-sending-concepts/hard-bounce) from [soft bounces](/email-sending-concepts/soft-bounce), or processing complaints differently from delivery confirmations. According to [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-message-filtering.html), these filter policies can be applied on a **per-subscription basis** (not at the topic level), allowing each processing system to receive only the events relevant to its function.

## SNS-SES Integration

AWS SES integrates natively with AWS SNS to provide **real-time feedback** on email sending activities. This integration is crucial for:

1. **Bounce Management**: When emails bounce, SNS delivers notifications containing detailed information about the bounce type, reason, and recipient.

2. **Complaint Handling**: When recipients mark emails as spam, SNS delivers notifications allowing senders to immediately remove these addresses from their lists.

3. **Delivery Confirmation**: SNS can notify when emails are successfully delivered, providing validation for critical communications.

4. **Format or Template Issues**: SNS delivers notifications when emails encounter format or template-related problems detected by SES (e.g., invalid content structures, template rendering failures), helping senders identify and fix these issues.

This feedback loop is essential for maintaining a **healthy sender reputation** and optimizing email deliverability rates.

## Why Use Amazon SNS for Email Operations

AWS SNS provides several benefits specifically for email systems, making it an essential component of a robust email infrastructure. The service offers **high reliability, durability, and scalability** while eliminating the operational complexity of managing messaging infrastructure.

For email operations specifically, SNS enables **real-time reaction to email events**, allowing immediate processing of feedback rather than waiting for batch processes. This immediate feedback loop helps maintain list hygiene, protect sender reputation, and ensure compliance with email sending best practices.

The ability to fan out notifications to multiple processing systems simultaneously means that a single email event can trigger updates to customer databases, analytics systems, and operational dashboards without complicated coordination between systems.

## Common Email Use Cases for SNS

1. **Bounce Processing Automation**: Create automated workflows that update suppression lists and contact databases when emails bounce, preventing further sending to invalid addresses.

2. **Complaint Handling Systems**: Implement immediate unsubscribe actions and sender reputation protection when recipients file spam complaints.

3. **Delivery Performance Monitoring**: Build real-time analytics dashboards to track campaign performance metrics and delivery success rates.

4. **Automated Workflows**: Initiate follow-up communications based on email interaction events (opens, clicks, etc.).

5. **Security Alerts**: Receive notifications about suspicious sending patterns or authentication failures.
