# AWS IAM Permissions

**AWS IAM Permissions** are the fine-grained authorizations that specify which actions an identity (user, group, or [role](/aws-concepts/iam-role)) can perform on specific AWS resources. They form the foundation of AWS's access control system, allowing organizations to implement the principle of least privilege across their cloud environments.

## What are IAM Permissions?

IAM Permissions are **access control statements** that define what actions are allowed or denied on which AWS resources. They are implemented through policy documents written in JSON format and attached to IAM identities. According to [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html), each permission statement contains several key elements:

- **Effect**: Specifies whether to "Allow" or "Deny" access
- **Action**: Defines the specific API operations that are covered by the rule
- **Resource**: Specifies the AWS resources to which the permissions apply
- **Condition** (optional): Sets requirements for when the permission is active

Unlike role-based access control (RBAC) systems which assign permissions based on job roles, AWS IAM uses attribute-based access control (ABAC), allowing for more dynamic and fine-grained permissions based on attributes of the user, resource, or environment.

## How IAM Permissions Work

IAM permissions operate through JSON policy documents attached to identities (users, groups, roles) or resources. A policy document contains one or more statements, each defining a specific permission. Here's a simple example:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This policy allows the identity to retrieve objects from the specified S3 bucket. The permission model is additive, with explicit denies taking precedence over allows. When a principal makes a request to AWS, the authorization system evaluates all applicable policies to determine whether the request should be allowed or denied.

AWS IAM uses a **deny-by-default** model, meaning that access to resources is denied unless explicitly allowed through permissions. This approach ensures that new AWS services or API actions aren't automatically accessible without deliberate authorization.

## Types of IAM Permission Policies

AWS IAM supports several types of policies that work together to define permissions:

| Policy Type | Attached To | Primary Purpose |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Identity-based Policies** | Users, groups, roles | Control what actions an identity can perform |
| **Resource-based Policies** | AWS resources | Control who can access a specific resource |
| **Permission Boundaries** | Users and roles | Set maximum permissions an identity can have |

These are the main policy types you'll encounter when working with AWS IAM. For comprehensive information about all policy types, including Service Control Policies and Session Policies, refer to the [AWS IAM Policy Types documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policy-types).

## Core Permission Concepts

The IAM permissions model revolves around six key elements: the **Principal** (user, role, or service) requests access to specific **Resources** (identified by ARNs) to perform **Actions** (API operations like `s3:GetObject`). The system handles **Authentication** (verifying identity via credentials) and **Authorization** (evaluating policies to permit/deny access), while **Conditions** enable context-based restrictions (time, IP, MFA). Understanding these components is essential for crafting effective IAM policies.


## IAM Permissions in Email Infrastructure

For AWS-based email systems like those using [Amazon SES](/aws-concepts/ses), carefully designed IAM permissions are essential for security and operational integrity:

- **Email Sending Permissions** such as `ses:SendEmail` and `ses:SendRawEmail` control who can send messages. These can be scoped to specific verified identities to control which domains and email addresses can be used for sending.

- **Configuration Management Permissions** like `ses:CreateConfigurationSet` and `ses:UpdateConfigurationSetEventDestination` determine who can modify SES settings, which should typically be limited to administrative users.

- **Notification Processing Permissions** enable systems to process [bounce](/email-sending-concepts/bounces) and [complaint](/email-sending-concepts/complaints) feedback through permissions like `sns:Subscribe` and `sns:Receive`.

- **Monitoring Permissions** such as `ses:GetSendStatistics` and `cloudwatch:GetMetricData` allow teams to track email performance without necessarily having permission to send email or change configurations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I view all permissions granted to a specific user or role?

The AWS IAM Access Analyzer provides policy evaluation capabilities, or you can use the AWS CLI command `aws iam get-policy` combined with `get-policy-version` to review policy contents. The IAM console also provides visual tools for examining permissions.

### How do I troubleshoot permission issues?

The AWS CloudTrail service logs all API calls with details about the request, including the identity, the action requested, and whether it was allowed or denied. The IAM console includes a policy simulator to test policies before applying them.

### Can permissions be temporary or conditional?

Yes, through session policies used with assumed roles and through condition elements in policies. Conditions can include time-based restrictions, source IP address requirements, resource tags, and many other attributes.
