faqs:
  - question: What is the difference between Amazon SES and other email service providers?
    answer: AWS SES is a "building block" email infrastructure with pay-as-you-go pricing, while most other ESPs offer all-in-one marketing platforms with built-in campaign tools. SES integrates well with other AWS services and is cost-effective for high volume, but requires more technical expertise to implement.
  - question: Does Amazon SES have sending limits?
    answer: Yes, new accounts start in a "sandbox" environment with restricted sending capabilities. After proving good sending practices, you can request production access to increase your sending quota (emails per day) and sending rate (emails per second). AWS evaluates your bounce and complaint rates before granting higher limits.
  - question: How does Amazon SES handle bounces and complaints?
    answer: SES automatically tracks bounces and complaints, which can be sent to SNS, S3, or trigger Lambda functions. You must maintain bounce rates below 5% and complaint rates below 0.1% to avoid sending restrictions. SES also maintains a suppression list to prevent sending to problematic addresses.

# Amazon SES (Simple Email Service)

**Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)** is a cloud-based email sending service designed to help digital marketers and application developers send marketing, notification, and transactional emails.

## What is Amazon SES?

Amazon SES is a **reliable, cost-effective service** that provides an easy way to send and receive email using your own email addresses and domains. It **eliminates the complexity** of maintaining your own email sending infrastructure.

### Key Features

- **High [Deliverability](/email-sending-concepts/deliverability)**: Amazon SES uses content filtering technologies and proactive bounce and [complaint](/email-sending-concepts/complaints) management to help maintain the sender reputation and achieve high inbox placement rates.
- **Flexible Configuration Options**: Set up your email sending based on your specific use case, whether it's transactional, marketing, or notification emails.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Access detailed metrics on delivery rates, [bounces](/email-sending-concepts/bounces.md), complaints, and rejections.
- **Advanced Email Features**: Support for custom headers, MIME types, attachments, and more.
- **Integration with Other AWS Services**: Works seamlessly with other AWS services like S3, [SNS](/aws-concepts/sns), and Lambda.
- **Email Receiving**: Route incoming emails to S3 buckets, trigger Lambda functions, or send notifications through SNS.
- **Dedicated IP Addresses**: Option to lease dedicated IP addresses for exclusive use.

## How Amazon SES Works

It operates on a robust cloud infrastructure designed with multiple layers to ensure reliable email delivery:

**1. Email Submission Layer**  
When your application sends an email, it communicates with SES through either **[SMTP](/email-sending-concepts/smtp) interface or API calls**. The API approach offers more features like template management and delivery metrics, while SMTP provides **universal compatibility** with existing email systems.

**2. Processing and Verification Layer**  
Once received, SES processes the email by checking **sender authentication**, applying content filtering, and validating against sending quotas. It verifies that you're authorized to send from the specified domain using [SPF](/email-sending-concepts/spf), [DKIM](/email-sending-concepts/dkim), and [DMARC](/email-sending-concepts/dmarc) protocols.

**3. Delivery Optimization Layer**  
SES uses **intelligent routing algorithms** to determine the optimal delivery path for each message. It maintains relationships with major ISPs and employs **adaptive delivery techniques** to adjust sending patterns based on recipient server responses.

**4. Feedback Loop System**  
The service **continuously monitors** delivery metrics including opens, clicks, bounces, and complaints. This data feeds back into the system to help **maintain your sender reputation** and improve future deliverability.

## Common Use Cases

- **Transactional Emails**: Order confirmations, password resets, and system notifications.
- **Marketing Emails**: Newsletters, promotional campaigns, and product updates.
- **Automated Notifications**: System alerts, monitoring notifications, and automated reports.
- **Bulk Sending**: Large-scale email campaigns to customer lists.

## Why Use Amazon SES?

Organizations choose Amazon SES for its unique combination of **scalability, cost-efficiency, reliability, and technical capabilities**. The service effortlessly handles email volumes from hundreds to millions without additional infrastructure provisioning, while its **pay-as-you-go model** eliminates upfront costs and minimum commitments. Built on Amazon's globally distributed infrastructure, SES ensures consistent delivery performance through redundant systems that minimize service disruptions. The built-in authentication support for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC protocols **improves deliverability rates** and protects sender reputation from [spoofing attacks](/email-sending-concepts/email-spoofing). Additionally, comprehensive API capabilities enable developers to **seamlessly integrate email functionality** into applications, automate workflows, and customize the sending experience to meet specific business requirements, making SES an ideal solution for companies seeking a powerful yet flexible email delivery platform.
