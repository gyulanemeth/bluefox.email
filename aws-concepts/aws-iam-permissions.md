# AWS IAM Permissions

**AWS IAM Permissions** are the fine-grained authorizations that specify which actions an identity (user, group, or [role](/aws-concepts/aws-iam-role)) can perform on specific AWS resources. They form the foundation of AWS's access control system, allowing organizations to implement the principle of least privilege across their cloud environments.

## What are IAM Permissions?

IAM Permissions are **access control statements** that define what actions are allowed or denied on which AWS resources. They are implemented through policy documents written in JSON format and attached to IAM identities. According to [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html), each permission statement contains several key elements:

- **Effect**: Specifies whether to "Allow" or "Deny" access
- **Action**: Defines the specific API operations that are covered by the rule
- **Resource**: Specifies the AWS resources to which the permissions apply
- **Condition** (optional): Sets requirements for when the permission is active

Unlike role-based access control (RBAC) systems which assign permissions based on job roles, AWS IAM uses attribute-based access control (ABAC), allowing for more dynamic and fine-grained permissions based on attributes of the user, resource, or environment.

## How IAM Permissions Work

IAM permissions operate through JSON policy documents attached to identities (users, groups, roles) or resources. A policy document contains one or more statements, each defining a specific permission. Here's a simple example:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This policy allows the identity to retrieve objects from the specified S3 bucket. The permission model is additive, with explicit denies taking precedence over allows. When a principal makes a request to AWS, the authorization system evaluates all applicable policies to determine whether the request should be allowed or denied.

AWS IAM uses a **deny-by-default** model, meaning that access to resources is denied unless explicitly allowed through permissions. This approach ensures that new AWS services or API actions aren't automatically accessible without deliberate authorization.

## Types of IAM Permission Policies

AWS IAM supports several types of policies that work together to define permissions:

**Identity-based policies** are attached directly to IAM identities (users, groups, roles). These can be:

- **Managed policies**: Standalone policies that can be attached to multiple identities
  - **AWS managed policies**: Created and maintained by AWS
  - **Customer managed policies**: Created and maintained by customers
- **Inline policies**: Embedded directly in a specific identity

**Resource-based policies** are attached directly to resources like S3 buckets, SQS queues, or KMS keys. These define who can access the resource and what actions they can perform.

**Permission boundaries** set the maximum permissions an identity can have, regardless of what other policies are attached. These are useful for delegating administration while maintaining control.

**Service control policies (SCPs)** apply to entire AWS Organizations or organizational units, setting guardrails for what actions accounts can perform.

**Session policies** limit permissions for temporary sessions assumed through federation or role assumption.

## Core Permission Concepts

Several important concepts underpin the IAM permissions model:

**Principal** is the entity requesting access to an AWS resource. This could be a user, role, AWS service, or federated user.

**Authentication** verifies the identity of the principal making the request through credentials like passwords, access keys, or session tokens.

**Authorization** determines whether a request should be allowed based on applicable policies.

**Actions** are the specific API calls or operations that can be performed, such as `s3:GetObject` or `ec2:StartInstances`.

**Resources** are the AWS entities that principals can perform actions on, identified by Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).

**Conditions** add contextual restrictions to permissions based on factors like time, IP address, or the presence of MFA.

## Permission Best Practices

When implementing IAM permissions, AWS recommends several security best practices: The **principle of least privilege** is fundamental â€“ grant only the permissions necessary for each entity to perform its specific tasks, starting with minimal permissions and adding more as needed based on actual usage patterns. Implement **permission boundaries** to establish maximum permissions an identity can have, preventing privilege escalation even if additional policies are attached later, which is especially important in larger teams where multiple administrators might manage different aspects of the infrastructure. Use **resource-level permissions** when possible to restrict actions to specific AWS resources rather than granting broad access, for example, allowing access to specific S3 buckets rather than all S3 buckets in the account. Apply **conditional permissions** based on factors like time, source IP, or the presence of MFA; for instance, you might require administrative changes to configurations to come from your corporate network IP range and use multi-factor authentication. According to [AWS security best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html), regularly reviewing and auditing permission usage helps identify and remove unnecessary access, reducing the risk of misuse or security incidents.

## IAM Permissions in Email Infrastructure

For AWS-based email systems like those using [Amazon SES](/aws-concepts/aws-ses), carefully designed IAM permissions are essential for security and operational integrity:

- **Email Sending Permissions** such as `ses:SendEmail` and `ses:SendRawEmail` control who can send messages. These can be scoped to specific verified identities to control which domains and email addresses can be used for sending.

- **Configuration Management Permissions** like `ses:CreateConfigurationSet` and `ses:UpdateConfigurationSetEventDestination` determine who can modify SES settings, which should typically be limited to administrative users.

- **Notification Processing Permissions** enable systems to process [bounce](/email-sending-concepts/bounces) and [complaint](/email-sending-concepts/complaints) feedback through permissions like `sns:Subscribe` and `sns:Receive`.

- **Monitoring Permissions** such as `ses:GetSendStatistics` and `cloudwatch:GetMetricData` allow teams to track email performance without necessarily having permission to send email or change configurations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I view all permissions granted to a specific user or role?

The AWS IAM Access Analyzer provides policy evaluation capabilities, or you can use the AWS CLI command `aws iam get-policy` combined with `get-policy-version` to review policy contents. The IAM console also provides visual tools for examining permissions.

### What's the difference between explicit and implicit denies?

An explicit deny is a statement in a policy with "Effect": "Deny", which always overrides any allows. An implicit deny occurs by default when there is no matching allow statement. Explicit denies are useful when you need to ensure certain actions cannot be performed regardless of other attached policies.

### How do I troubleshoot permission issues?

The AWS CloudTrail service logs all API calls with details about the request, including the identity, the action requested, and whether it was allowed or denied. The IAM console includes a policy simulator to test policies before applying them.

### Can permissions be temporary or conditional?

Yes, through session policies used with assumed roles and through condition elements in policies. Conditions can include time-based restrictions, source IP address requirements, resource tags, and many other attributes.

### What permission model should I use for different team members?

AWS recommends using groups for team-based permissions, with users assigned to appropriate groups. For temporary elevated access, use role assumption rather than modifying base permissions. For DevOps teams, consider combining permission boundaries with broader role permissions.
