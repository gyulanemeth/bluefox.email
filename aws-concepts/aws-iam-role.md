# AWS IAM Role

An **AWS IAM Role** is an identity that defines permissions for AWS services or users to access resources without using permanent credentials. Roles provide temporary security credentials that expire automatically.

## What is an AWS IAM Role?

An IAM Role acts as a **secure delegation mechanism** that grants permissions without requiring long-term access keys, improving security by eliminating the need to share or embed credentials in application code. Each role consists of a trust policy that defines which entities can assume the role and permission policies that specify what actions are allowed on specific AWS resources. This **identity-based access control** approach follows AWS security best practices by providing just-in-time privileges. According to [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html), roles can be assumed by various entities including AWS services (like Lambda or EC2), applications running on compute instances, **federated identity providers** (like Active Directory or Google), or users from different AWS accounts in cross-account scenarios.

## How IAM Roles Work

When an entity assumes a role, the **AWS Security Token Service (STS)** handles the authentication process and provides **temporary security credentials** valid for a configurable duration between 15 minutes (900 seconds) and 12 hours (43200 seconds), as specified in [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html). These credentials include an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token that must be included in subsequent AWS API requests. This dynamic credential model eliminates the need to store long-lived access keys in code or configuration files, enhances security through **automatic credential rotation**, implements least privilege principles by granting permissions only when needed, and creates seamless service-to-service authentication without manual intervention. The role assumption process happens invisibly to end users, with services like Lambda or EC2 handling the underlying STS API calls and credential management automatically.

## Common Role Types

AWS offers several specialized **role types** for different authentication scenarios and security requirements. **Service Roles** are specifically designed to be assumed by AWS services like CloudWatch, SES, or SNS, allowing these services to perform actions on your behalf through predefined trust relationships that identify the specific service as the principal. **Lambda Execution Roles** provide the serverless function runtime with precisely scoped permissions to access other AWS resources like databases, storage services, or messaging systems during function invocation. **Instance Profiles** serve as containers for IAM roles that provide temporary credentials to applications running on EC2 instances through the instance metadata service, eliminating the need for storing credentials in application files. **Cross-Account Roles** enable controlled access between separate AWS accounts in organizational structures, allowing users or services in one account to perform specified actions in another account based on carefully crafted permissions.

## IAM Roles for Email Systems

When building robust email infrastructure with [Amazon SES](/aws-concepts/aws-ses), you'll need several carefully designed **role configurations** to maintain security and operational efficiency:

- **SES Notification Handler Role**: Allows Lambda functions to process [bounce](/email-sending-concepts/bounces) and [complaint](/email-sending-concepts/complaints) events from [SNS topics](/aws-concepts/aws-sns-topics). Requires permissions to read from specific SNS topics and update suppression lists or database records to maintain list hygiene and deliverability.

- **Email Sending Role**: Grants applications permission to send emails via SES while enforcing governance through IAM conditions that limit which verified identities can be used as senders. Prevents unauthorized domain usage while enabling legitimate messaging.

- **Analytics Processing Role**: Enables monitoring services to read delivery metrics, generate reports, and update dashboards with performance data without providing unnecessary administrative access.

- **Configuration Management Role**: Provides elevated privileges for updating SES settings, managing templates, and configuring event destinations. Typically restricted to DevOps personnel or deployment pipelines.

Creating these **properly scoped roles** for each function significantly improves security posture by ensuring each component has only the permissions it needs for its specific task, implementing the principle of least privilege throughout your email architecture.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between an IAM Role and an IAM User?

A Role provides temporary credentials that expire, while a User has permanent credentials. Roles are for programmatic access by services, while Users represent human operators or system accounts.

### How do I monitor role usage?

AWS CloudTrail logs all API calls, including role assumptions. You can use CloudTrail logs to track which entities are using your roles and what actions they're performing.

### Can I restrict when a role can be used?

Yes, with IAM condition elements in policies. You can restrict roles based on time of day, source IP address, MFA status, and many other factors.

### How do I set up a role for SES event processing?

Create a role with a trust policy allowing Lambda to assume it, then add permissions policies granting access to SNS topics containing SES events and any downstream services needed to process those events.
