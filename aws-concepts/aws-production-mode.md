# Amazon SES Production Mode

**Amazon SES Production Mode** is the unrestricted operational state that follows the initial [sandbox environment](/aws-concepts/aws-sandbox) for AWS SES accounts. It removes sandbox limitations and enables sending to any recipient with higher volume and throughput capabilities.

## Key Features of Amazon SES Production Mode

- **Unrestricted Recipients**: Ability to send to any valid email address (not just verified addresses)
- **Higher Sending Quotas**: Significantly increased [daily sending limits](/aws-concepts/aws-sending-quota) (typically starting at 50,000 emails/24 hours)
- **Faster Sending Rates**: Enhanced [sending rate](/aws-concepts/aws-sending-rate) capabilities (typically starting at 14 emails/second)
- **Continued Monitoring**: Ongoing performance tracking with potential for automatic quota increases
- **Full API & SMTP Access**: Complete access to all SES features and capabilities

## How Production Mode Works

Access to production mode is granted after submitting a formal request through the [AWS Support Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html). AWS evaluates each request based on your compliance with email best practices and the quality of your historical sending metrics.

Once approved, your account gains expanded sending capabilities. Specifically, your [sending quota](/aws-concepts/aws-sending-quota) increases from 200 emails/day to a higher limit (typically 50,000 emails/day), and your [sending rate](/aws-concepts/aws-sending-rate) grows from 1 email/second to a higher throughput (typically 14 emails/second). These enhanced limits enable wide-scale email campaigns, customer notifications, and business-critical communications.

In production mode, AWS continues to monitor your **sending reputation** with particular attention to:

- **[Bounce rates](/email-sending-concepts/bounce-rate)** (target below 5%)
- **[Complaint rates](/email-sending-concepts/complaints)** (target below 0.1%)
- **Content quality** and **recipient engagement**

Strong performance may trigger **automatic quota increases** over time, while deteriorating metrics can result in restrictions or return to sandbox status.

## Benefits of Production Mode Access

Moving to production mode provides several significant advantages:

1. **Business Scalability**: Support for larger email volumes aligned with business growth needs
2. **Operational Efficiency**: Higher throughput for time-sensitive communications
3. **Broader Reach**: Ability to contact any recipient with valid email address
4. **Testing Flexibility**: Easier testing across varied email domains and providers
5. **Enhanced Deliverability**: Access to robust email reputation management tools

## Requirements for Production Mode Approval

To transition from [sandbox](/aws-concepts/aws-sandbox) to production status, AWS conducts a comprehensive evaluation of your sending practices and infrastructure. Successful applications demonstrate **clear, legitimate use cases** for email communications and provide evidence of **documented opt-in processes** that create permission-based recipient lists. AWS closely examines **content quality**, ensuring messages are professional and non-spammy, while verifying proper implementation of email **authentication protocols** like [SPF](/email-sending-concepts/spf), [DKIM](/email-sending-concepts/dkim), and [DMARC](/email-sending-concepts/dmarc). Applicants must demonstrate functional **compliance measures** including systems for handling [bounces](/email-sending-concepts/bounces) and [complaints](/email-sending-concepts/complaints), alongside a clear, functioning **unsubscribe mechanism** that respects recipient preferences. AWS particularly emphasizes maintaining bounce rates **below 5%** and complaint rates **below 0.1%** as critical thresholds for production status approval.

## Maintaining Production Status

Once in production mode, ongoing compliance with AWS sending policies is essential to maintain your status. Successful senders must consistently **monitor key metrics** by tracking bounce and complaint rates through the SES console or CloudWatch to detect potential issues early. Regular list hygiene through **cleaning subscriber databases** helps remove inactive contacts and unengaged recipients, ensuring your messages target only interested audiences. Implementing robust **feedback loops** that process bounce notifications via [SNS](/aws-concepts/aws-sns) or webhooks allows immediate response to delivery failures. When expanding email operations, employ a strategy of **gradual volume increases** rather than sudden spikes that might trigger spam filters. Finally, incorporate **content testing** using anti-spam tools to evaluate messages before sending, helping identify potential deliverability issues before they impact your sender reputation.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Production Mode

### How long does it take to get production access?

Most requests are reviewed within **24â€“48 hours**. Complex cases or requests for unusually high quotas may take longer.

### Can my account be returned to sandbox status?

Yes. If your account consistently exceeds AWS's acceptable bounce and complaint rates or violates AWS policies, your account may be returned to sandbox status.

### Do I need to request production access for each AWS region?

Yes. Production status is granted on a per-region basis. If you use SES in multiple regions, you'll need to request production access for each one.

### How do I know if my account is in production mode?

Check your SES console dashboard. Production accounts show significantly higher sending quotas than the sandbox limit of 200 emails/day.
