# Amazon SNS Topics

**Amazon SNS Topics** are named communication channels within the Simple Notification Service that serve as the central connection point between message publishers and subscribers. In email delivery systems, SNS Topics play a **vital role** in managing and distributing notifications about email events such as bounces, complaints, and deliveries as part of the [Amazon SNS](/aws-concepts/aws-sns) service.

## What are Amazon SNS Topics?

An SNS Topic is a logical access point and communication channel in Amazon Simple Notification Service. It functions as an **event router** that receives messages from publishers and fans them out to all subscribed endpoints. For email operations, topics are the backbone of feedback processing systems, enabling real-time handling of important delivery events.

According to [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-getting-started.html), a single SNS topic can support deliveries to **millions of endpoints**, making it suitable for high-volume email notification processing.

## How SNS Topics Work

SNS Topics operate through a publish-subscribe architecture that enables one-to-many message distribution. When a topic receives a message, it immediately makes copies and distributes them to all subscribed endpoints. This **fan-out pattern** is fundamental to understanding how email event notifications work.

A key feature of SNS Topics is **message filtering**, which allows [subscribers](/aws-concepts/aws-sns-subscription) to receive only specific message types. In email systems, this means different processors can receive only the specific email events they're designed to handle, such as bounces or complaints.

## Topic Types and Characteristics

Amazon SNS offers two distinct topic types with different delivery characteristics:

**Standard Topics** provide high-throughput, best-effort message ordering with at-least-once delivery guarantees. These topics can handle virtually unlimited messages per second according to [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-publishing-to-topics.html), making them ideal for most email notification scenarios.

**FIFO Topics** (First-In-First-Out) deliver messages in the exact order they're published with exactly-once processing guarantees. These topics are useful when the precise sequence of email events matters, though they have lower throughput limits than Standard Topics.

## Core Benefits of SNS Topics

SNS Topics provide several fundamental benefits in message distribution systems:

The **real-time nature** enables immediate reaction to events as they occur, which is vital for time-sensitive notifications like email delivery issues.

Their **scalable architecture** handles varying message volumes without configuration changes. According to [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-publishing-to-topics.html), standard topics can support virtually unlimited messages per second.

The **loose coupling** principle means that publishers and subscribers can evolve independently, creating more flexible and maintainable system architectures.

## Frequently Asked Questions About SNS Topics

### How many subscribers can an SNS Topic have?
A single SNS Topic can support up to **12.5 million subscriptions** across various endpoint types, according to AWS documentation.

### Can SNS Topics guarantee message processing order?
Standard SNS Topics provide best-effort ordering but don't guarantee it. FIFO Topics ensure strict ordering with exactly-once processing guarantees, though with lower throughput.

### How reliable is message delivery with SNS Topics?
SNS implements a **"at-least-once" delivery model** with automatic retries for failed deliveries. This design ensures high message durability even during temporary endpoint disruptions.
