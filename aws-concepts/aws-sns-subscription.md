# Amazon SNS Subscription

An **SNS Subscription** is the mechanism that connects a notification [topic](/aws-concepts/aws-sns-topics) to a specific endpoint destination within [Amazon SNS](/aws-concepts/aws-sns). In email delivery systems, AWS SNS subscriptions enable the **automated processing** of important events like bounces, complaints, and delivery confirmations.

## What is an Amazon SNS Subscription?

An SNS Subscription is a configuration that defines where and how notifications from an SNS Topic should be delivered. It creates a **persistent link** between a topic and an endpoint, allowing messages published to the topic to be automatically forwarded to the subscribed destination.

For email delivery systems, subscriptions are the critical connection points that ensure notifications about email events reach the appropriate processing systems. According to [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sns.html#limits_sns), a standard SNS Topic can support up to **12.5 million subscriptions** across various endpoint types.

## How SNS Subscriptions Work

SNS Subscriptions operate through a comprehensive workflow that begins with creation and ends with message delivery. A subscription is created by specifying an SNS Topic ARN (Amazon Resource Name) and an endpoint destination. The endpoint type must be one of the supported protocols: HTTP/S, Email, Email-JSON, Amazon SQS, AWS Lambda, SMS, or platform application endpoints.

Many subscription types require confirmation before they become active. This **two-step verification** process ensures that the endpoint owner has deliberately chosen to receive notifications, which is particularly important for public-facing endpoints like HTTP webhooks. Once confirmed, the subscription becomes active and begins receiving messages.

Subscriptions can include optional filter policies that determine which subset of messages from the topic should be delivered to the endpoint. This enables **targeted processing** where different systems can subscribe to the same topic but receive only the specific notification types they're designed to handle. For example, one system might process only hard [bounces](/email-sending-concepts/bounce-management) while another handles spam [complaints](/email-sending-concepts/email-complaints).

When a message matching the subscription's filter policy is published to the topic, SNS delivers it to the endpoint using the appropriate protocol-specific format. Delivery includes **automatic retries** if the endpoint is temporarily unavailable, with different retry strategies depending on the endpoint type.

## Subscription Protocols for Email Systems

SNS supports various subscription protocols that serve different needs in email operations. Lambda subscriptions are the **most common pattern** for modern email systems, enabling serverless functions to process email events immediately without infrastructure maintenance. SQS subscriptions deliver events to message queues, providing a **buffer against traffic spikes** and ensuring no events are lost during processing peaks. HTTP/S endpoints allow integration with existing web applications or on-premises systems, with AWS providing up to **100,000 delivery retries** over 23 days according to the [SNS Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-message-delivery-retries.html). Email and Email-JSON subscriptions, while less common for automated processing, can alert human operators about critical anomalies in email events that require investigation.

## Subscription Filter Policies

Filter policies are JSON documents attached to AWS SNS subscriptions that determine which messages the subscription should receive. They enable sophisticated event routing without modifying the publishing application. Key capabilities include:

- **Event-type routing**: Directing different email events (bounces, complaints, deliveries) to specialized processing systems
- **Bounce differentiation**: Distinguishing between hard bounces (requiring immediate address removal) and soft bounces (triggering temporary suppression)
- **Domain-specific processing**: Routing events for different sending domains to separate endpoints for multi-tenant architectures
- **Advanced matching**: Supporting exact matches, prefix matching, numeric comparisons, and existence checks for **highly customized** routing

These filter policies represent one of the most powerful features of SNS for email operations, enabling precise control over notification flow without complex code changes.

## Why SNS Subscriptions Are Critical for Email Operations

SNS Subscriptions provide essential benefits that make them fundamental to professional email delivery systems. The **notification delivery guarantees** ensure that important email events are never lost, even during processing disruptions or maintenance windows, protecting sender reputation by ensuring all bounce and complaint data is captured.

Their **flexible filtering capabilities** allow complex event routing without modifying publishers, enabling specialized processing for different types of email events or recipient domains. This means that as email operations grow more complex, the notification architecture can evolve without requiring changes to the email sending systems themselves.

With **cross-account capabilities**, email events can be shared with analytics, compliance, or partner systems running in separate AWS accounts, supporting sophisticated organizational architectures. This feature is particularly valuable for large enterprises where email operations, analytics, and compliance functions might be handled by different teams or organizational units.

The **protocol diversity** allows email events to be processed by various systems simultaneously, from serverless functions to traditional web applications, accommodating diverse technical environments. According to [AWS best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/monitor-sending-activity.html), implementing proper subscription configurations for email feedback is **essential** for maintaining high deliverability rates and sender reputation.

## Use Cases for SNS Subscriptions in Email Systems

Amazon SNS Subscriptions enable numerous critical functions in email delivery operations:

- **Bounce Processing Pipeline**: Multiple subscriptions to a bounce topic can route events to different systems simultaneouslyâ€”Lambda functions for suppression list updates, SQS queues for analytics, and HTTP endpoints for CRM integration

- **Tiered Complaint Handling**: Filter policies can distinguish between complaint categories, routing severe spam reports to urgent response systems while sending milder feedback to standard channels

- **Cross-Environment Testing**: Subscriptions can connect production email events to development environments with appropriate filtering, allowing testing with real-world data patterns

- **Multi-Region Resilience**: Critical email systems can create subscriptions delivering events to redundant processing systems across multiple regions, ensuring continuity during regional disruptions

## Frequently Asked Questions About SNS Subscriptions

### How do I ensure my subscription doesn't miss any messages?

SNS guarantees **at-least-once delivery** to active subscriptions. For mission-critical processing, combine SNS with SQS to create a durable buffer. The SQS queue will store messages even if your processing system is temporarily unavailable, ensuring no email events are missed.

### Can different subscriptions receive different message formats?

Yes. Each subscription type receives messages formatted appropriately for its protocol. Additionally, SNS supports raw message delivery for SQS and Lambda subscriptions, allowing these endpoints to receive messages without the standard SNS message wrapper.

### What happens if an endpoint repeatedly fails to process messages?

If an HTTP/S endpoint consistently fails, the subscription enters a **disabled state** after the retry policy is exhausted. For Lambda and SQS endpoints, failures are handled according to their respective retry and dead-letter queue configurations. This prevents endless delivery attempts to malfunctioning systems.
