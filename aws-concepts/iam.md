faqs:
  - question: "How does IAM evaluate multiple policies when determining access?"
    answer: "IAM uses a deny-by-default model. Any explicit deny overrides allows, and if no policy explicitly allows an action, access is denied."
  - question: "What is the difference between IAM roles and users?"
    answer: "Users have permanent credentials for individuals. Roles provide temporary credentials that can be assumed by trusted entities for time-limited access."
  - question: "How does IAM support the Zero Trust security model?"
    answer: "IAM enforces 'never trust, always verify' by requiring authentication for every request. It uses contextual conditions and fine-grained permissions to limit access to only what's necessary."
  - question: "What are IAM best practices for secure AWS environments?"
    answer: "Apply least privilege, use roles instead of access keys, enforce MFA, regularly audit permissions, and implement permission boundaries."

# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is a foundational security service that provides centralized access control for AWS resources. It enables organizations to securely manage identities and their relationships to AWS services through authentication (verifying identity) and authorization (determining access rights).

## The Conceptual Framework of IAM

At its core, IAM addresses a fundamental security question: "Who can do what to which resources under what conditions?" This question encompasses the entire spectrum of access control in cloud environments. IAM provides this control through a structured security model with four key dimensions:

1. **Principals** (the "who"): Entities requesting access, which can be human users or machine processes
2. **Actions** (the "what"): Specific operations that can be performed on AWS services
3. **Resources** (the "which"): The AWS service components being accessed
4. **Conditions** (the "when/where"): Contextual restrictions like time, location, or security state

This framework implements two critical security principles: the **principle of least privilege** (granting only necessary access) and **defense in depth** (multiple layers of security controls).

## Core Components of the IAM System

IAM operates through three primary identity types and various access control mechanisms working together as an integrated system. The identity components include **IAM Users** (representations of individuals or services with unique credentials), **IAM Groups** (collections of users sharing common access requirements), and **[IAM Roles](/aws-concepts/iam-role)** (identity containers assumed by trusted entities for temporary access without permanent credentials). These identities are governed by access control mechanisms, primarily through **[IAM Policies](/aws-concepts/iam-permissions)** - JSON documents that define precise permissions by specifying allowed or denied actions on specific resources under defined conditions. Additionally, **Permission Boundaries** set maximum permission limits regardless of attached policies, while **Service Control Policies** provide organization-wide guardrails across entire AWS accounts.

## Authentication Methods in IAM

IAM supports a spectrum of authentication methods that reflect the evolution of identity verification in cloud environments. These range from traditional password-based console authentication and long-term access keys for programmatic access, to enhanced security options like **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** requiring physical or virtual devices. For modern applications, IAM offers temporary security credentials through **AWS Security Token Service**, along with federation capabilities that integrate with external identity providers (like Google or Facebook) and enterprise identity systems (via SAML). This flexible authentication framework allows organizations to implement verification mechanisms that balance security requirements with operational needs across diverse access patterns and identity sources.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does IAM evaluate multiple policies when determining access?
IAM uses a deny-by-default model. Any explicit deny overrides allows, and if no policy explicitly allows an action, access is denied.

### What is the difference between IAM roles and users?
Users have permanent credentials for individuals. Roles provide temporary credentials that can be assumed by trusted entities for time-limited access.

### How does IAM support the Zero Trust security model?
IAM enforces "never trust, always verify" by requiring authentication for every request. It uses contextual conditions and fine-grained permissions to limit access to only what's necessary.

### What are IAM best practices for secure AWS environments?
Apply least privilege, use roles instead of access keys, enforce MFA, regularly audit permissions, and implement permission boundaries.
