# Account Dashboard

The **Account Dashboard** gives you an overview of your entire account’s email and subscription performance across multiple projects. It allows you to track key metrics for [**transactional emails**](/docs/projects/transactional-emails#transactional-email-statistics), [**triggered emails**](/docs/projects/triggered-emails#triggered-email-statistics), [**campaign Emails**](/docs/projects/campaigns#campaign-email-statistics), and [**subscriber lists**](/docs/projects/contacts#list-statistics). The dashboard also provides insights into subscriber behaviors, such as subscriptions, pauses, unsubscribes, and re-subscriptions, giving you a holistic view of your account’s health.

## How the Account Dashboard Enhances Your Strategy

The **Account Dashboard** helps you:

- **Monitor All Projects at Once**: Track the performance of your emails and subscribers across all your projects in one place.
- **Get a 360° View of Email Effectiveness**: Measure the performance of different types of emails (transactional, triggered, and campaign emails) across your entire account.
- **Track Subscriber Trends**: See how subscribers are engaging with your emails, including their subscription, pause, unpause, and unsubscribe behaviors.
- **Identify Performance Issues**: Quickly detect trends like [high bounce rates](/email-sending-concepts/bounce-rate.md) or low open rates across all projects, helping you to address potential issues before they escalate.
- **Enhance Subscriber Engagement**: Use data from multiple projects to optimize future emails and improve subscriber retention and conversions.

## Key Metrics in the Account Dashboard

The **Account Dashboard** provides both **email performance** and **subscriber activity** metrics across all your projects, giving you a comprehensive view of your account's performance.

### 1. Email Performance Metrics Across All Projects
- **Sent Emails**: The total number of emails sent across all projects, including transactional, triggered, and campaign emails.
- **Opens**: The total number of email opens across all projects.
- **Unique Opens**: The number of unique recipients who opened emails across all your projects.
- **Clicks**: The total number of clicks on links inside your emails, reflecting how engaging your content is.
- **Unique Clicks**: The number of unique recipients who clicked on links, highlighting how effective your emails are at driving action.
