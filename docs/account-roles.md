# Account Roles

bluefox.email uses a role-based access control system to manage permissions within your account. Understanding these roles helps you control who can access your projects and what actions they can perform.

## Role Overview

There are two primary account roles in bluefox.email:

- **User**: Standard account member with access to assigned projects.
- **Admin**: Account administrator with full control over projects and user access management.

## User Role

Users are standard members of your account with limited permissions. A **User** can:

- Access projects that have been assigned to them.
- Perform tasks within their assigned projects based on their **client access level**.
- View and interact with email campaigns, automations, contacts, and analytics within their assigned scope.

Users cannot manage other team members or modify account-wide settings.

## Admin Role

**Admins** have full control over the account and can manage all projects and team members. An **Admin** can:

- Access all projects in the account.
- Manage client access by assigning **Editor** or **Viewer** permissions to users.
- Create, edit, and delete projects.
- Manage team members and their roles.
- Configure account settings and integrations.
- Control billing and subscription features.

## Client Access Levels

When an Admin grants access to a project, they can assign one of two **client access levels** that determine what a user can do within that project:

### Editor Access

**Editors** have full control over the assigned project. They can:

- Create, edit, and delete campaigns, automations, and templates.
- Manage subscriber lists and contacts.
- Configure project settings.
- View and export analytics and reports.
- Test and send emails.

### Viewer Access

**Viewers** have read-only access to the assigned project. They can:

- View all campaigns, automations, and templates.
- Access and analyze analytics and reports.
- View subscriber lists and contact information.
- Preview emails and automations.

**Viewers cannot** create, edit, delete, or send any content. This access level is ideal for stakeholders who need to monitor performance without making changes.

## Managing Client Access

### For Admins: Granting Access

To grant a user access to a project:

1. Navigate to the project's **Settings** or **Team** section.
2. Click the **Add Member** or **Invite User** button.
3. Enter the user's email address.
4. Select the access level:
   - **Editor** for full project control.
   - **Viewer** for read-only access.
5. Click **Send Invite** or **Confirm**.

The user will receive an invitation to join the project with the specified access level.

### For Admins: Modifying Access

To change a user's access level:

1. Go to the project's **Settings** or **Team** section.
2. Find the user in the members list.
3. Click the **Edit** or **Menu** icon next to their name.
4. Select the new access level (**Editor** or **Viewer**).
5. Save your changes.

### For Admins: Removing Access

To revoke a user's access to a project:

1. Navigate to the project's **Settings** or **Team** section.
2. Find the user in the members list.
3. Click the **Remove** or **Delete** icon.
4. Confirm the removal.

The user will no longer have access to the project.

## Summary

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **User** | Access assigned projects only, restricted by client access level |
| **Admin** | Full account access, manage projects, and control team member permissions |
| **Editor** (Client Access) | Full project control: create, edit, delete, and send |
| **Viewer** (Client Access) | Read-only project access: view and analyze only |

By using these roles and access levels, you can ensure that team members and clients have the appropriate level of control and visibility within your bluefox.email account.
