# Theme settings

You can customize the theme you have selected when you created your project, by changing these parameters. There are the following parameter types: colors, font stacks, images, texts, and links.

These variables are used all around the theme's blocks and templates, so if you change them here, they will be changed everywhere, except for campaigns that you already have sent.

If you override a theme parameter, that will be only affect this project, other project will be unaffected.

You can also reset your parameters to the theme's default values.
  
::: warning
The theme of a project cannot be changed. If you have created a project with a theme, then it will stay as it is. If you need to change the theme of your emails, we suggest to create a new project with another theme.
