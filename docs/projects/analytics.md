# Project Dashboard

The project dashboard offers a comprehensive view of your email and subscription performance, combining metrics from [**transactional emails**](/docs/projects/transactional-emails#transactional-email-statistics), [**triggered emails**](/docs/projects/triggered-emails#triggered-email-statistics), [**campaigns**](/docs/projects/campaigns#campaign-email-statistics), and [**subscriber Lists**](/docs/projects/subscriber-lists#subscriber-list-statistics). By reviewing this data, you can identify trends like high unsubscribes or low engagement, optimize your subscriber lists, and improve email campaigns to boost retention, open rates, and click-through rates. These insights help you track performance, adjust strategies, and maintain a healthy subscriber base.
