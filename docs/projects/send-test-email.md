# Send Test Email

Before sending a campaign, triggered email, or transactional email to your entire audience, it's important to test it first. The send test email feature allows you to preview how your email will appear and verify that all personalization, links, and formatting are working correctly. You can send test emails to individual contacts or to an entire subscriber list, ensuring everything is perfect before hitting send.

## Why Test Emails Matter

Testing your emails before sending them to your full audience helps you:

- **Verify Content**: Ensure all text, images, and formatting display correctly across different email clients.
- **Check Personalization**: Confirm that merge tags and handlebars variables are rendering with actual data.
- **Test Links**: Validate that all links in your email are working and pointing to the correct destinations.
- **Review Layout**: Check how your email looks on different devices and screen sizes.
- **Catch Errors**: Identify and fix any spelling, grammar, or layout issues before they reach your audience.

## Accessing Send Test Email

You can access the send test email feature from your campaign, triggered email, or transactional email card. Look for the send test button or option in your email details.
