# Email Theme Settings

You can customize the settings for the email theme you selected when creating your project. Setting types include colors, font stacks, images, texts, and links. To access these settings, navigate to your project and select the **Email Theme Settings** tab.

These settings are used throughout blocks and templates defined in the email theme. When you change a setting here, it updates everywhere in your project except for campaigns that have already been sent.

There are two main sections in the email theme settings:
- **Basics** : These are general settings that apply to the entire email theme, such as colors, font family, logos , links,etc.

- **Components** : These are specific blocks that you can use in your emails like buttons, dividers, texts, images,etc.
