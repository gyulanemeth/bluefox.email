# Projects

Projects in bluefox.email can be associated with your projects' different environments. For example, if you have a SaaS, you might have a dev, a staging, and a production environment. You can create one separate project in bluefox.email for those environments.

Every project is associated with a specific theme (design system) that you can customize.

Every project has
 - subscriber lists
 - transactional emails
 - triggered emails
 - campaigns

A project is also associated with a sending email address, as well as your AWS credentials with allows us to send emails with your AWS SES.
