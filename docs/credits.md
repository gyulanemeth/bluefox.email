# Pricing

No subscriptions... No contact-based pricing... No overly complicated pricing model where you pay more (or differently) for marketing emails.

You pay for what you use. For sake of simplicity, you can buy credit packs that you can use for a whole year. (Credits expire after a year.)

## How credits work

You can buy credit packs in your workspace. It means that you can use your credits for all of your projects in your workspace.

1 credit = 1 send without branding. (We don't add our logo + link to your emails.)

OR

1 credit = 2 sends with branding. (We add our logo + link to your emails.)

Credits expire after a year. Yes, that also means that you can buy a credit pack and even use it for a whole year! (Buy once, use for months or even a year.)

branded send -> -1 credit
non-branded send -> -0.5 credit

AWS SES price (need to pay for that as well!!!)

## Free credits

1 free credit = 1 sends branding. (We add our logo + link to your emails.)

It is aligned with AWS SES' free tier, in which you get 3000 free sends per month.

It means you have a whole year to kick off your project with free email sending!

## Credit packs

The generic rule of thumb with our credit packs is the bigger credit pack you buy, the less you need to pay per credit.

### Start-up credit pack

100 thousand credits. Credits expire after a year.

Price: $50

With this credit pack, you can either send:
 - 100.000 emails without bluefox.email brandng (we don't put our logo & link into your emails)
 - or 200.000 emails with bluefox.email branding (we put our logo & link into your emails)

This credit pack is suitable for new projects. For example, if you send ten thousand emails per month (or you expect to send that many in soon). This credit pack will be enough for your needs for 10 months. If you send five thousand emails per month, then the annual number of sends is 60 thousand. Although you will not use all of your credits in this case, but it is still the best deal you can find on the market. Feel free to check out our competitors and do your calculations.

### Scale-up credit pack

Buy this credit pack if you already send quite a lot of emails, for example 50-200 thousand emails per month. If you send more than 500 thousand emails per month, it might be a good idea to buy more than one "Scale-up" credit packs at once, so you won't accidentally run out of credits.
