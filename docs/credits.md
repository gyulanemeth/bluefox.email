# Pricing

No subscriptions, no expensive contact-based fees, and no complex pricing that charges you more for marketing emails than transactional ones. We keep it simple: you only pay for what you use.

You can purchase credit packs that last a full year, offering you the flexibility to send emails on your schedule. (Credits expire after 12 months.)

## How Credits Work

Credits are purchased within your workspace, giving you the freedom to use them across all projects in that workspace.

- **1 credit = 1 send without branding** (no bluefox.email logo or link in your emails).
- **1 credit = 2 sends with branding** (bluefox.email logo and link included in your emails).

In simple terms:
- **Branded send** -> -0.5 credit
- **Non-branded send** -> -1 credit

Credits last for a full year, allowing you to buy once and utilize your credit pack at your own pace.

**Note:** You’ll also need to pay AWS SES fees for each email sent.

## Free Credits

To help you get started, we provide **36,000 free credits** when you create a new workspace (account). These credits let you send branded emails at no cost as you begin. (We put our logo and link into your emails.) This offer complements the AWS SES free tier, which grants 3,000 free sends per month for a year, allowing you to start strong without upfront email expenses.

## Credit Packs

Our credit packs follow a straightforward principle: the more credits you purchase, the lower your cost per credit. Here’s a look at the available options:

### Start-up Credit Pack

- **100,000 credits** (valid for one year)
- **Price:** $50

With this pack, you can send:
- **100,000 emails** without branding (no bluefox.email logo or link)
- **200,000 emails** with branding (bluefox.email logo and link included in your emails)

Ideal for smaller projects, this pack covers approximately 10,000 monthly emails for 10 months. If you send five thousand emails per month, then the annual number of sends is 60 thousand. Although you will not use all of your credits in this case, but it is still the best deal you can find on the market. Feel free to check out our competitors and do your calculations. 

Compare our rates with other providers, and you’ll find exceptional value.

### Scale-up Credit Pack
