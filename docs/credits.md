# Pricing

No subscriptions, no expensive contact-based fees, and no complex pricing that charges you more for marketing emails than transactional ones. We keep it simple: you only pay for what you use.

You can purchase credit packs that last a full year, offering you the flexibility to send emails on your schedule. (Credits expire after 12 months.)

## How Credits Work

Credits are purchased within your workspace, giving you the freedom to use them across all projects in that workspace.

**1 send = 2 credits** if you use our sending infrastructure, and **1 send = 1 credit** if you bring your own Amazon SES (bluefox.email logo and link included in your emails).

Credits last for a full year, allowing you to buy once and utilize your credit pack at your own pace.

**Note:** In the "bring your own Amazon SES version, you’ll also need to pay AWS SES fees for each email sent ($1 / 10,000 emails).

## Free Credits

To help you get started, we provide **3000 free credits per month for a whole year** when you create a new workspace (account). This offer complements the AWS SES free tier, which grants 1,500 free sends per month for a year if you use our sending infrastructure, and 3,000 sends, if you bring your own Amazon SES.

Free credits allow you to start strong without upfront email expenses.

## Credit Packs

Our credit packs follow a straightforward principle: the more credits you purchase, the lower your cost per credit. Here’s a look at the available options:

### Start-up Credit Pack

- **100,000 credits** (valid for one year)
- **Price:** $50

With this pack, you can send **50,000 emails** if you use our sending infrastructure, and **100,000 emails** if you bring your own Amazon SES.

Ideal for smaller projects, this pack covers approximately 10,000 monthly emails for 10 months. If you send five thousand emails per month, then the annual number of sends is 60 thousand. Although you will not use all of your credits in this case, but it is still the best deal you can find on the market. Feel free to check out our competitors and do your calculations. 

Compare our rates with other providers, and you’ll find exceptional value.

### Scale-up Credit Pack

- **1 million credits** (valid for one year)
- **Price:** $300

With this pack, you can send **500,000** emails if you use our sending infrastructure, and **1,000,000 emails** if you bring your own Amazon SES.

Recommended for those sending 50,000 to 200,000 emails monthly. If your needs exceed 500,000 monthly emails, consider multiple "Scale-up" packs to ensure uninterrupted service.

### Grown-up Credit Pack

- **Price:** $2,500
