# Pricing

No subscriptions, no expensive contact-based fees, and no complex pricing that charges you more for marketing emails than transactional ones. We keep it simple: you only pay for what you use.

You can purchase send packs that last a full year, offering you the flexibility to send emails on your schedule. (Sends expire after 12 months.)

## How Sends Work

Sends are purchased within your workspace, giving you the freedom to use them across all projects in that workspace.

**1 send = 1 send** if you use our sending infrastructure, and **1 send = 1 send** if you bring your own Amazon SES (bluefox.email logo and link included in your emails).

Sends last for a full year, allowing you to buy once and utilize your send pack at your own pace.

**Note:** In the "bring your own Amazon SES" version, you'll also need to pay AWS SES fees for each email sent ($0.10 / 1,000 emails).

## Free Sends

To help you get started, we provide **3,000 free sends per month for a whole year** when you create a new workspace (account). This offer complements the AWS SES free tier, which grants 1,500 free sends per month for a year if you use our sending infrastructure, and 3,000 sends if you bring your own Amazon SES.

Free sends allow you to start strong without upfront email expenses.

## Send Packs

Our send packs follow a straightforward principle: the more sends you purchase, the lower your cost per send. Here's a look at the available options:

### Essential Pack

- **50,000 sends** (valid for one year)
- **Price:** $50

With this pack, you can send **50,000 emails** if you use our sending infrastructure, and **50,000 emails** if you bring your own Amazon SES.

Ideal for smaller projects, this pack covers approximately 10,000 monthly emails for 5 months. If you send 5,000 emails per month, then the annual number of sends is 60,000. Although you will not use all of your sends in this case, but it is still the best deal you can find on the market. Feel free to check out our competitors and do your calculations.

Compare our rates with other providers, and you'll find exceptional value.

### Premium Pack

- **500,000 sends** (valid for one year)
- **Price:** $300

With this pack, you can send **500,000 emails** if you use our sending infrastructure, and **500,000 emails** if you bring your own Amazon SES.

Recommended for those sending 50,000 to 200,000 emails monthly. If your needs exceed 500,000 monthly emails, consider multiple "Premium" packs to ensure uninterrupted service.

### Enterprise Solution

For requirements beyond 500,000 sends, dedicated servers, or custom solutions, please [contact us](mailto:hello@bluefox.email) to discuss a tailored package.

## Bring Your Own Amazon SES (BYO SES)

With BlueFox Email's optional BYO SES delivery mode, you can use your own Amazon SES account while enjoying all our platform features.

**How BYO SES Works:**

When using BYO SES, you purchase send packs from us (for platform access and features), and pay AWS directly for sending costs. This gives you complete control over your sending infrastructure while leveraging our platform capabilities.

**Pricing Breakdown:**

- **Essential Pack:** $50 (platform fee) + ~$5 (AWS cost for 50,000 sends) = ~$55 total
- **Premium Pack:** $300 (platform fee) + ~$50 (AWS cost for 500,000 sends) = ~$350 total

AWS charges $0.10 per 1,000 emails sent through Amazon SES.

**Why Choose BYO SES?**

- Keep your sending reputation with AWS
- Maintain complete control over your AWS account
- Combine with AWS free tier (1,500 free sends per month for 12 months)
- Ideal if you already use Amazon SES
- No lock-in to our sending infrastructure
