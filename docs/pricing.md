# Pricing

No subscriptions, no expensive contact-based fees, and no complex pricing that charges you more for marketing emails than transactional ones. We keep it simple: you only pay for what you use.

You can purchase send packs that last a full year, offering you the flexibility to send emails on your schedule. (Sends expire after 12 months.)

## How Sends Work

Sends are purchased within your workspace and can be used across all your projects. Each send represents one email delivered to a recipient.

**With Standard Pricing (BlueFox Managed Infrastructure):**
- Buy a send pack once, use your sends anytime within 12 months
- No per-contact fees, no hidden charges, just straightforward email delivery
- Example: A 50,000 send pack lets you send 50,000 emails at your own pace

**With BYO SES Pricing (Your Amazon SES Account):**
- Buy a platform fee pack to access features and sending capability
- You also pay AWS directly for each email sent ($1 per 10,000 emails)
- You maintain complete control over your AWS account and sending reputation
- Example: A $50 platform pack for 100,000 sends + ~$10 AWS fees = ~$60 total

**Key Benefits:**
- No subscriptions, buy once, send whenever
- Stack packs by purchasing multiple (no limits)
- All features included in every pack

## Free Sends

To help you get started, we provide **free send credits** when you create a new workspace:

- **Standard Pricing:** 3,000 free sends
- **BYO SES Pricing:** 6,000 free sends

These credits are added to your account upon registration and can be used anytime within the year. They work alongside the AWS SES free tier if you use BYO SES (which grants 1,500 free sends per month for 12 months).

## Send Packs

Our send packs follow a straightforward principle: the more sends you purchase, the lower your cost per send. Here's a look at the available options:

### Standard Pricing

#### Essential Pack

- **50,000 sends** (valid for one year)
- **Price:** $50
- **Cost per send:** $0.001 ($1 per 1,000 sends)

With this pack, you can send **50,000 emails per month** if needed. For example, if you send **10,000 emails monthly**, the pack will last you about 5 months. Alternatively, if you send **5,000 emails monthly**, you'll have sends remaining for the full year.

**Example:** At 5,000 emails/month = 60,000 annual sends needed, but this pack gives you 50,000 sends. You'd want the Premium pack for consistent monthly sending at that volume.

#### Premium Pack

- **500,000 sends** (valid for one year)
- **Price:** $300
- **Cost per send:** $0.0006 ($0.60 per 1,000 sends)

Recommended for those sending **50,000 to 200,000 emails monthly**. This pack provides excellent value at scale. If your needs exceed 500,000 sends, consider purchasing multiple Premium packs or contact us for custom solutions.

### Bring Your Own Amazon SES (BYO SES)

With BlueFox Email's optional BYO SES delivery mode, you can use your own Amazon SES account while enjoying all our platform features.

#### Essential Pack (BYO SES)

- **100,000 sends** (valid for one year)
- **Platform Fee:** $50
- **Platform cost per send:** $0.0005 ($0.50 per 1,000 sends)
- **Plus AWS SES Cost:** ~$10 (100,000 sends × $0.0001 per send)
- **Total Approximate Cost:** ~$60

#### Premium Pack (BYO SES)

- **1,000,000 sends** (valid for one year)
- **Platform Fee:** $300
- **Platform cost per send:** $0.0003 ($0.30 per 1,000 sends)
- **Plus AWS SES Cost:** ~$100 (1,000,000 sends × $0.0001 per send)
- **Total Approximate Cost:** ~$400

**AWS SES Rate:** $0.10 per 1,000 emails sent (or $1 per 10,000 sends)

**Why Choose BYO SES?**

- Keep your sending reputation with AWS
- Maintain complete control over your AWS account
- Combine with AWS free tier (1,500 free sends per month for 12 months)
- Ideal if you already use Amazon SES
- No lock-in to our sending infrastructure
- Better value at high volumes (1M+ sends)
