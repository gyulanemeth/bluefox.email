# Pricing

No subscriptions, no expensive contact-based fees, and no complex pricing models. We keep it simple: **you only pay for what you send**.

Purchase send packs that last a full year at your own pace. All features—automations, segmentation, analytics, client workspaces, and deliverability tools—are included in every pack. No feature gating.

## How Send Packs Work

Send packs are simple: you buy a pack of sends and use them anytime within 12 months. When you hit zero, buy another pack. Your remaining sends never expire within that year.

**1 send = 1 send** with our sending infrastructure (BlueFox Email).

**1 send = 1 send** with your own Amazon SES (optional), plus you pay AWS directly ($0.10 per 1,000 emails).

Sends are shared across your entire workspace, so you can manage multiple client projects with a single pack.

**Note:** With BYO SES, you also pay Amazon Web Services fees directly for each email sent ($0.10 per 1,000 emails). This is separate from our platform fee.

## Free Sends

Every new workspace gets **3,000 free sends monthly for the first year**—no credit card required. This gives you time to explore BlueFox Email risk-free.

Free sends are perfect for testing automations, building client workflows, and getting familiar with the platform before purchasing a pack.

## Send Packs

Our pricing is transparent and predictable. The more sends you buy, the better your rate:

### Start-up Pack

- **50,000 sends** (valid for 12 months)
- **Price:** $50
- **Cost per 1,000 sends:** $1.00

Perfect for agencies managing 10-20 client accounts or testing BlueFox Email with high-volume sends. Use all 50,000 sends or keep some for next quarter—they're yours for a full year.

**What's included:**
- All features (automations, segmentation, analytics)
- Client workspaces with isolated domains

- 12-month send validity

### Scale-up Pack

- **500,000 sends** (valid for 12 months)
- **Price:** $300
- **Cost per 1,000 sends:** $0.60

Recommended for agencies sending 50,000+ emails monthly or managing 50+ client accounts. This pack offers the best value for growing teams.

**What's included:**
- All Start-up features

## Bring Your Own Amazon SES (BYO SES)

Prefer to use your own Amazon SES account? That's optional and fully supported.

With BYO SES, you:
- Keep your sending reputation with AWS
- Maintain direct control over your AWS account
- Pay us for platform access (our send pack fee)
- Pay AWS directly for sending ($0.10 per 1,000 emails)

This option is ideal if you already use Amazon SES or want complete control over your infrastructure.

**BYO SES Pricing:**

| Pack | Sends | Platform Fee | AWS Cost (est.) | Total Cost (est.) |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Start-up | 50,000 | $50 | $5 | ~$55 |
| Scale-up | 500,000 | $300 | $50 | ~$350 |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long do my sends last?**
Sends are valid for 12 months from purchase. You can use them anytime within that year—there's no monthly minimum or usage requirement.

**What happens if I don't use all my sends?**
Your unused sends roll over within the 12-month window. After 12 months, unused sends expire.

**Can I buy multiple packs?**
Yes! You can purchase as many packs as you need. Multiple packs combine into your workspace balance, so you don't need to track individual purchases.

**Do you charge per contact?**
No. We don't charge based on list size, subscriber count, or contact volume. You only pay for sends.

**What features are included?**
All features are included in every pack: automations, segmentation, email templates, analytics, A/B testing, client workspaces, bounce handling, DMARC alignment, authentication audits, and more.

**Can I upgrade or downgrade?**
You can purchase additional packs at any time. There's no downgrade option, but your sends never expire within 12 months, so you can use them at your own pace.

**Do you offer annual discounts?**
For custom volume or annual commitments, please [contact sales](mailto:hello@bluefox.email). We offer volume discounts and multi-year pricing.

**How does BYO SES pricing compare?**
With BYO SES, you pay our platform fee plus AWS costs (~$0.10 per 1,000 emails). On the Start-up pack, that's approximately $1.10 per 1,000 emails total. This is cheaper than most competitors if you already use AWS SES.

**Do I need a credit card to start?**
No. Your free 3,000 monthly sends don't require a credit card. When you're ready to purchase a pack, we accept all major credit cards.

**What if I need more sends than a single pack?**
You can purchase multiple packs simultaneously. For very high volumes, [contact sales](mailto:hello@bluefox.email) for custom enterprise pricing with volume discounts.
